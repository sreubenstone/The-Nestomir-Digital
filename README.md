# The Nestomir Digital React Native Client

### Overview

Let's create a timeless educational tale for the next generation of learners...earn community status and rewards‚Äìhelp push American (and global) STEM education forward ü§ì ‚òÑÔ∏è.

> We put together this effort to bring Americans (and the world) together through creativity and collaboration!

üò∫ _Please note, the codebase is a little messy. This was started a few years ago. We need your help to improve it._

See the [main project page here](https://www.thenestomir.com), as well as [the central story repository here](https://www.github.com/sreubenstone/thenestomir). Please see our Contributor Agreement & Additional Repository Terms at the bottom of this document

### What is The Nestomir?

The Nestomir is a planetary quest (fantasy novel and companion app) involving a crash-landed alien warrior, a troubled 12-year-old boy, a mysterious learning force permeating the universe and 9 computer science lessons which grant students superpowers. It follows the main character, Jake Addison, through a series of quests which introduce him to computer programming and a new "learn with purpose" learning philosophy. **And now through crowd participation, we're going to improve the the story and social reading app experience together.**

### Setting up the app

##### The Repository

- clone this repository to your local machine
- toggle into the workspace directory
- install packages via `npm i`

##### ngrok

In order to easily connect [The Nestomir Backend](https://github.com/sreubenstone/The-Nestomir-Digital-Server) (which runs locally on port 4000) to our Expo client, which is required for our app to run, we need to connect our local port 4000 to the internet using a tool like ngrok. It is a utility to expose any locally hosted application over the web. See installation instructions [here](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/ngrok-introduction/).

##### Config file

You must have the [backend server setup and running](https://github.com/sreubenstone/The-Nestomir-Digital-Server) for the client to work. In dev, we only need to update the `dev_server` url in our config file, which we get from running `ngrok http 4000` in a new terminal window.

```
const dev_server = "<Port 4000 NGROK link goes here>";
```

#### Running the app

`yarn start`

[https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/) for a basic Expo tutorial on creating and running a new app (worth the read!) Note, we can load the app on our actual device or through simulator.

##### Tech stack

- React Native [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) ‚Äì¬†for graphQL based state management

##### Codebase structure

- Component folder broken down into Book, Forum, Glossary, Login, Notifications, Other, Profile, Progress, Support
- React native entry file is App.tsx
- Assets stored in /assets
