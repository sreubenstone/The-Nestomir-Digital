### What I've Got So Far

- Child(s) and parent(s) are bound somehow in the data model
- When each completes a segment && -- an sms is sent to both child and parent like "Let's discuss....."
- Parent can mark the conversation as complete -- stats update....can time notification logic based on completion intervals across parties.
- Community forum (chat, moderators, experts)
