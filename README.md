Fits into story well. 

User's need to be able to find it really fast. 

User's will not have a birds eye view of the entire forum.

Need to answer what are the advantages of doing things inline?

- Motivational to see who's moving forward
- You won't give away the story potentially
- You can ask questions in the moment...and supplement the reading, without having to retrace topics.
- Suggested threads + start your own thread.
- I would purely provide front end mock ups for the team. We can't make a hard decision right now. And I need to discuss monetization with a core team.
- We want to see other people's progress
- Modal would be cool to still see the story in the background

Possible options

Show story check points (threads)

>>> I'd prototype the inline story check point. Inside the actual chapter. See how that goes.
