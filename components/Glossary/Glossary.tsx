      "Print is a built in Python function. We use it anywhere in our code to display the result of a specific value in our program to OUR TERMINAL. Print is essential because when a program runs, we can't actually SEE anything happening UNLESS we display the results of certain steps of our program to our screen (terminal). You will get NOWHERE as a coder without learning how to use print. Even senior engineers use PRINT ALL OVER THEIR PROGRAMS. It helps us catch mistakes EARLY. As humans, we're prone to making careless errors, as well as legitimate errors. This is fine, we just need a way of easily isolating these issues which is what PRINT enables us to do (most of the time)! In other words print() is a coders BEST FRIEND!!",
