Technically a function is an algorithm, but, when we use the term algorithm, we usually mean a set of steps that help us perform a data intensive task, like sorting or organizing large sets of information. This goes back to the culture of coding...as seen in the lesson here...when tasks become data or information heavy...it really really matters how we structure our code...because we can cause expensive time losses in our program. So, with respect to coding, an algorithm refers to this data heavy use case of instructions (not always, but usually).",

These two fractions have identical values, the only real difference being that the first is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.

The terminal is essentially is a way for us to talk natively with our computer's operating system. When we run a Python program, that program is interfacing with our computer's operating system. When we use a command like print() for example, we are telling the computer's operating system to display a value it is housing in memory to our screen. Because the terminal is the native way a human can speak to our computer, the computer displays that value on the terminal. Most code editors give us quick access to our computer's terminal...it's a small sub window with a blinking cursor. The terminal is also where we tell our computer's operating system to run our python program.",
