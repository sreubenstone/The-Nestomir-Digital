const body1 = `Rex dove into him quite hard. His cold nose pressing against Jake’s right eye socket. It caught Jake off guard -- as Jake was currently in a state of deep slumber -- in the middle of a dream concerning an argument he had in school the previous day. It was milliseconds before Jake realized what was happening. Rex, the family beast, as they called him, often came into Jake’s room on weekdays to wake him up. Jake’s mother often made bacon and eggs for him to get him satiated for a day of schooling. It was possible Rex was inspired by the bacon. This probably caused Rex to wake Jake up so the food got served faster.

Jake spent a minute petting Rex. He specifically enjoyed getting right underneath Rex’s chin, digging his fingers in, not too forcefully, but just enough to put Rex in a temporary state of Euphoria. Jake then put on his clothing. He could smell the scent of bacon and eggs streaming into his room and it added a jolt of encouragement to Jake’s step as he got dressed. He put on a pair of shorts and his favorite Aquaman t-shirt. 

Jake walked down the steps and saw his mom mixing the eggs with some cheese. His brother Jimmy, who was 3 years younger, was eating cereal. 

“Nice shirt, bro. Aren’t you like 12 already?”, Jimmy shouted at his brother abruptly. 

“It’s my favorite character! And I’m still young enough to like this stuff!”, Jake responded. 

Jake had an intense passion for Aquaman. He loved watching the movies over and over again. It was certainly a nerdy passion -- but Jake wasn’t exactly a nerd. He just took great pleasure in the fantasy world that Aquaman created in his mental sphere. It gave him an escape from the day to day events in Grapefield.

“Calm down children, Jake needs to eat, so we can get to school on time. You can argue about your favorite movie characters later”, his mom interjected. 

Jake picked at the eggs and bacon. His mom usually mastered the dish, but today the eggs were a little over cooked, and something was off with the bacon. He wasn’t sure what it was. He managed to finish 3 quarters of the plate and quickly tossed the rest out so his mom wouldn’t see he did not finish the meal she put so much energy into making.

They got into the car and headed on the 5 minute journey to Grapefield Middle School. The family minivan was not a beautiful vehicle but it got the job done. It hummed down Angle street, the street where they lived, making a slow, and deep, hum, as it traversed down the street. The streets in Grapefield were pretty, especially in the fall. A rich yellow and brown luster seemed to be emitted from everywhere in sight, as the leaves cascaded on top of lawns, roofs, and freshly laid pavement.

5 minutes later they approached Grapefield Middle’s opening gates. Jake’s mother pulled the car up directly in front of the school’s main entrance. This usually made Jake cringe as he had to get out of his mom’s car in front of all of the bypassing students entering the school. Jake hesitantly got out of the car and his mother wished him good luck with the day. “Don’t fall asleep in class Jake! I know what Ms. Thornton told me about last week!”, his mother yelled. The mini van pulled off headed towards Grapefield Elementary.

Grapefield Middle was a relatively normal suburban middle school. Classes started at 8:50 am and ended at 2:10 pm every school day. Grapefield Middle had the usual cliques, and personalities from each grade. Different reading groups, athletes, nerds, and everything in between populated the classrooms and hallways. School lunch and recess were the most prized moments of the student schedule. Students dreaded homework assignments and long papers. Teachers reported gossip, and complained about poorly behaving students in the faculty lounges, and school bullies patrolled the hallways looking for their next victim.

This day of seventh grade for Jake was pretty mundane -- Jake passed slowly through Algebra, and Social Studies. Jake was almost certain he had entered a 20 minute slumber in Social Studies. 

In Earth Science his teacher went on and on about the importance of sedimentary rock formations. Jake did not know that a person could have such a passion for rocks. He pretended to listen to what his teacher was saying. He saw a few students in the back of the classroom snoozing. His friend Jason always kept a pen upright in his hand, so that when he fell asleep in class it appeared as if he was still awake; even if his face was flat down against the desk. It seemed to fool his teacher more times than not.

Jake was putting his Earth Science textbook into his locker when Roger came up from behind him. Roger, a student one year older than Jake, took the back of Jake’s neck and slammed his forehead against the locker. Jake simultaneously tried to turn around and yelled “what the hell man!”, but Roger bear hugged Jake’s body and put his right leg in front of Jake’s right leg and pushed. Jake fell to the ground, and a few textbooks from Jake’s locker followed to drop on Jake’s leg. “Ow, sh^t!”, Jake yelled. 

Roger backed away for a moment. “That’s what you get for being such a dweeb”, Roger said. Roger than proceeded to take one giant kick at Jake’s right thigh. Jake screamed “AOOHHWW”, and Roger disappeared down the hall.

Roger had chosen Jake as a bullying target at the end of Jake’s freshman year at Grapefield Middle. Jake was watching the Grapefield High School Football team after school when Roger saw Jake sitting in the bleachers, apparently looking like a fresh target. “That’s a funny looking haircut dude”, Roger shouted at him. Jake turned around and saw the vicious, somewhat crazy look, that many bullies have, in Roger’s eyes, and tried to look away. From then on, any time he saw Roger, something unpleasant would happen to him, like a sarcastic shout, name calling, or some kind of minor physical intimidation.

Jake stood up, he could feel the center of his thigh throbbing. He threw his textbooks into his locker and walked slowly down the hallway. Jake was becoming fed up with the day.

In social studies Jake was fidgeting. Aggravated thoughts were streaming through his mind as he contemplated Roger. A few of the students turned around to see what was causing the subtle screeching noise coming from the back of the room. Jake was moving the tip of his broken pencil against the laminate finish of his desk. He was getting even more irritated by how slowly time was passing. He just wanted to get home. 

With about 25 minutes left in the period something in Jake told him he had enough of lectures for the day. He he raised his hand and asked to go to the bathroom. Mrs. O’Reily granted him permission. Jake tucked his textbook and pencil under his arm and walked out of the room.

He continued walking down the hall towards the emergency exit. That’s when the love of his life shouted at him.

“Hey dude!!”, yelled Ashley. 

Ashley was one of the most beautiful girls in Grapefield Middle, and Jake had spent a fair part of Algebra class staring at her. She was the love of Jake’s life. Jake had also never spoken to her.

“He, hey”, Jake said as cool as he could, not trying to sound surprised Ashley was talking to him. It took him a second to maintain any sense of composure.

“You’re Jake right?

“Yea, yes”, said Jake.

“I think you’re in my Algebra class. Sorry, I fell asleep early last night. Is there anyway I could borrow the homework assignment due tomorrow?”, Ashley asked.

“Sorry, I don’t have it. I’m probably going to flunk.”, Jake responded. 

“Oh, okay, no worries. By the way is your leg ok? I see you’re limping.”

“Yes, it’s fine”. 

“Ok, well I’m also having a birthday party next weekend at Cheeseman’s in town. You should come. The info’s online. I’ll invite you.”

“Oh, oh, well, thank, thanks. I, I will take a look.”

“Great! See you later.”

“What a weird occurrence”, Jake thought. Getting beaten up by Roger and then speaking to Ashley for the first time all in the span of an hour and change. 

“I’m glad I had my adrenaline running, or else I’m not sure I would have been able to speak to her at all,'' Jake thought to himself.

Jake continued walking down the hallway. It was a long one. Many classrooms on each side, he could see teachers teaching, and students sitting at their desks. Occasionally he’d see a head turn to see who was walking by. 

Jake had hit the exit staircase on the east side of school. He couldn’t stand being in Grapefield Middle or those hallways, or those classes, any longer that day. A part of him, whether it was gut, or something else, made him walk outside. 2 hours before classes ended, he opened the school doors and walked out. He kept on walking down the path, thinking about where to go. He had no desire to return home yet. He thought of all the places that made him happy. Finally it came to him. An old temptation. A place the tougher kids used to talk about. JT’s Fireworks.

Jake headed down Barley road, which led straight into town from Grapefield Middle School. It was about a 15 minute walk. Jake began the trek. 

Jake walked down Barley Street. The Fall trees were in phase, dropping all sorts of exotic colored leaves on the ground. A few strangers and some familiar faces looked at him. It was odd to see a child this early in the day on the Grapefield streets. But nothing else was made of it. 

Grapefield was a charming suburban town, at least most of it. Grapefield, located in central Wisconsin, was a typical middle class suburban that you would see in the movies. The houses were charming and quaint. Parents had two to three children. The summers were hot. The winters were cold. The Fall was particularly beautiful. Parents, like anywhere else, prayed for the best for their kids. School was competitive, but not as competitive as some of the suburban towns on the east and west coasts. Life was good here for most. 

The central town of Grapefield was well constructed. It had two main streets, Barley Street, and Amherst Road. They intersected in the center of town. The best italian spots, asian restaurants, coffee shops, and ice cream parlours all lay on Barley. The key grocery, hardware, and supply stores lay on Amherst.

Jake kept on walking down Barley. South, and more south. He passed a variety of restaurants and saw some familiar faces eating lunch. Ten minutes later he began to approach Lemmingfield -- the notorious poor neighborhood in the southern part of Grapefield. The misfits and delinquents were rumoured to stir up the most trouble here. Of course, there were plenty of honest people of modest means living here, but the neighborhood was known to have its fair share of issues. 

Jake had never been this far south in Grapefield. A few notorious children from Grapefield Middle and High had been heard describing JT’s in the past. “A glorious store” they had called it. Filled with all things fireworks and mischievous recreation.

Jake had a distant memory in his head of a story he heard from Bill Jones, a very cool, older bad a*s, currently in Grapefield High. Bill is the older brother of Jimmy Jones in Jake’s grade. Jake and Jimmy were outside Grapefield Middle when Jake eavesdropped on Bill telling a story to a few girls about his journeys to JT’s and how Bill almost blew up the dock at Grape Lake on a July 4th weekend. Jake was always amused by the tale. 

Jake could see he was crossing Washington Street, as he walked down Barley. He knew from the map he was approaching Lemmingfield. That meant that JT’s was only a few blocks away. The streets were noticeably not as well taken care of here. Whereas the northern part of the town had perfectly paved streets, and uncracked sidewalks, down here the streets and sidewalks looked like they had not been paved in decades. There were also plenty of disheveled warehouses and broken down garages populating both sides of the street.

Jake continued walking for another minute. And there she was! Standing on the south west side of Barley & Crescent Ave, was JT’s. She looked as beautiful as Jake imagined. A massive old fashioned neon sign with a big fireworks icon stood above the store’s entrance. It looked like a hardware store, but Jake knew what it held inside.

Jake walked into JT’s. He could hear the sound effect in his head that tv shows make when a character finds a hidden palace or something to that effect. “TaDaaah”. The store had 10 aisles, with an endless assortment of fireworks, firecrackers, and plenty of other gizmos Jake couldn’t recognize going off in all directions.

Jake saw a few bikers with leather jackets walking around the aisles exchanging jokes between one another, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying.

Jake’s mood began to pick up has he wanted around the store. He had been sullen on his walk, thinking about Roger’s actions towards him. He was feeling weak for even giving Roger that much attention in his thoughts. His leg was still severely charlie-horsed -- and the anger caused by someone treating him that way was not something Jake could easily remove from his psyche.

Jake continued to walk down the magnificent aisles. He approached what looked like big red rockets. These massive fireworks were too big for even Jake’s current mischievous appetite. He wanted something particularly simple that he could mess around with to let his stress out, and let the day shake off him. 

He walked around the shouting bikers and saw a few Jelly Rocket packs. He knew what these little guys could do. They were little Roman Candles that blew jelly everywhere once they were fully lit. 

“Perfect”, Jake thought to himself.

He checked out at the cash register in the front of the store right behind the bikers. The bikers had three enormous bags filled with who knows what inside of them. 

Jake completed his checkout, and walked out of JT’s, Jelly Poppers in hand, with some new pep in his step. As he walked outside onto Barley street, he could smell a faint, yet distinctive scent coming from an alley on the west side of the street. It smelled like a mixture of cedar and firework smoke. It was an odd smell, but it was a pleasing scent. Something like a mixture of toy rocket engines and some kind of exotic tree or plant. 

He followed the scent, though he was not sure if he had just picked up some of the “explosive” material seeping through the doors of the fireworks store. Those Estes engines and fireworks dust did smell good. But this was different. It smelled, better? 

As he walked towards the ally, the smell faded away. “Must be in my head”, Jake thought. But a sudden passing gust of wind brought the smell back, but this time it was significantly stronger. This changed his mind again. 

He continued into the ally. It was dark and smelled of garbage, but the cedary-alabaster scent was still there.  He was startled as he tripped and almost fell on a homeless man laying under a few layers of filthy tarps on the ground. “Sorry”, he said and accelerated his pace through the alley.

The other side of the alley finally opened up onto a well lit street, which marked the complete edge of the town. Across the street was a wooden fence which enclosed a massive many-thousand acre cornfield. The street lamps were illuminating the first cut of the corn plants swaying in the nightly wind. 

The scent was getting stronger again. Jake walked across the street and ducked under the wooden picket fence. He was now in the cornfield. 

“Wow, these things are huge,'' Jake muttered out loud. Each corn stalk was considerably taller than him. Jake would never have guessed.It was overwhelming. He was not able to see more than a foot or so in each direction. But the smell was still there, and the sky above him gave him some comfort that he was not entirely suffocating in the corn. 

He continued walking. He curved right, following a path of slightly shorter corn stalks. He noticed some black sut on a few of them. He continued walking and continued seeing some more of this black sut on the top of the corn stalk leaves. He wiped his finger on a corn leaf, and tasted the sut. Iit resembled the cedary smell from before, but a little more raw and smokey. 

As the minutes went on, this stroll through the corn became a relaxed effort. It was a complete juxtaposition to the busy suburban life Jake was used to in Grapefield. He was in real nature. The sky was clear above him. Jake couldn’t believe this seemingly alternate universe sat so near  his house and he was never aware of it. 

“Woah, what the f*ck was that?”, he muttered, as a thick plume of smoke pushed up through the corn field and surrounded him and moved past him. Something was smoking. Something was on fire, not too far off in the distance. 

He continued walking. He ducked a little to the right again as he followed the scent. He could see the tips of each stalk were showing burn marks. It appeared as if a lighter had been gently put to the top of them.

He swiveled his head back and forth to examine the stalks. 
It became obvious that something odd was going on about thirty degrees to the right of the direction he was walking. The stalks in this direction were burnt nearly down to the ground. This was peculiar, at the least. Jake followed in this direction, walking over these extremely short, burnt, stalks. He followed this direction for another minute, until he entered a large circular opening in the field, and then he saw it, or no, he heard it. 

A low, but powerful grumble made the ground tremble. A thick scaled tail was sticking out of the ground about two feet in front of where Jake entered this round pit. The tale was wiggling slowly. Then, a massive sandstorm erupted from the ground, at least that’s what it felt like. And then its head came up out of the sand. It’s dark red eyes turned towards Jake.
