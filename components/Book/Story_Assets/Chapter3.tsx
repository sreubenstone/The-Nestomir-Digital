const ChapterThree1 = `They were speeding through the clouds. The sensation of moving at this high of a velocity outdoors was inconceivable. Gigantic puffs of cumulus clouds the size of small apartment buildings passed by them almost instantaneously. 

"Is this a dream?" Jake thought to himself. "If this is a stress-induced hallucination, then when is it going to end? If it's not — then how is this possible? What will my mother and brother think when I'm not home in the morning?". Jake’s thoughts continued to race through his grey matter at a speed mirroring his physical velocity.

Jake staired in front of him as the dragon creature banked effortlessly in both directions to avoid larger, more intimidating storm clouds.

Jake couldn't help but notice the tattoo markings on the creature's wings. They were intimidating. They appeared to be tribal tattoos. Some markings were brighter than others. They were obviously related to the creature’s lessons with The Utma. But seeing so many, all over the body, gave rise to the growing impression in Jake that this creature had a history much darker than he could envisage.

The other otherworldly occurrence in this flight setting was the fact the speeding air they were moving so quickly through had no meaningful impact on Jake. There was a gentle breeze hitting his face, but there was undoubtedly some kind of indiscernible barrier bulwarking Jake from the oncoming air. It was also enabling his voice to carry to the creature. 

"I, I, never asked you your name...Draconi..Draconian", Jake said loudly, as he directed his trembling voice to the extraterrestrial dragon, some thirty thousand feet above the ground, as they shot in between different pockets of air and marshmallow looking clouds.

The creature’s neck turned almost imperceptibly to the right, as if to focus its voice towards Jake. 

"Yes. You are right. My apologies. My name is Dendro. Well, my full name is Dendronian Frektole Draconadium The Fourth. But I go by Dendro.", the creature said. “No one calls me by my full name.”

"Ok. I see. Got it. Dendro, I see. Weh. Well, ok, cool.,” Jake said, his voice still trembling a bit. 

“Dendro, ok”. Jake said out loud to himself. 

Jake noticed Dendro shifting the orientation of his body to prepare for an oncoming gust of wind. Jake held onto the saddle tightly, however, he did not feel much effect of the force of Dendro’s flight movements. The banked forty five degrees to the right, however, Jake still felt up right. 

They leveled out again. The air seemed calm and the cloud density softened.

A reality started to slowly seep into Jake’s mind. If this was real, this creature was definitely not from Earth. His curiosity began to slowly fight back against his terror.

The stars above were glowing with intense radiance. Jake tried to maintain his focus on a larger star directly ahead to see if it was possible to make it out in any further detail. He had no luck, but as he looked around the celestial heavens something shifted. The stars weren’t as distant somehow.

They continued flying silently for half an hour, until Jake could no longer resist the urge to speak.

"What is your world like Dendro? How far is it from Earth?" Jake inquired.

Jake replayed the question that just came out of his mouth in his head. He never envisioned himself asking anyone or anything, what world they hailed from.

"Naronia, is a planet approximately three and a half million light years from your home planet Earth. Our planet is situated in a Magellanic Galaxy called The Nestomir. The Nestomir takes up a vast physical space, however, the only planets we know of with life exist in our Star System, which we Nestomirians refer to as Star System A. Naronia is a complicated world, and I would have trouble knowing where to start with respect to answering your question. It is a busy world, with a copious amount of races and species working together. The planet Naronia is the capital of The Nestomir Galaxy.", Dendro replied.

“Wow. That far? That is unimaginable. A capital? An entire galaxy?, Jake responded as his head rolled back into more thought.

“It is shocking to some one who is not aware of the Universal situation and life beyond their home world”, Dendro replied who then proceeded to bank hard left. Inertia was still present as Dendro made these high G maneuvers, but not at anywhere near their full intensity. Jake felt his stomach come up his esophagus on this maneuver. He coughed loudly.

“I am sorry about that Jake. I sometimes forget how unnatural these air maneuvers can be to even a trained pilot. I will try my best to smooth out the ride, but I can not guarantee it will be perfect.”, Dendro commented.

They sped through the air silently for some time. Jake looked in fascination at the ground thousands of feet below them.

“Why are we being followed? Why were you half-submerged inside of a gravel pit in a cornfield in Grapefield, Wisconsin?” Jake asked. “Grapefield, one of the least happening places on Earth?, he added.

"Yes. I understand you must be feeling tremendous shock. Situations like these that jump out at you when you least expect it. For me as well. They can disturb the mind greatly. I beg you to stay calm, I think we are going to get out of this alright.”, Dendro replied.

“You think?” Jake shuddered and felt cold chills run down his spine.

“Yes”, Dendro said emphatically.

The short answer irritated Jake.

“I need more than that”, Jake said contentiously.

Dendro was shifting their altitude slightly, up, and down, to avoid turbulent pockets of air. It did not feel great on the stomach once again.

“Jake, for me to explain everything on this short flight would be impossible. But please recognize, I am a friend. And the people after us are our enemy.”

“Our great enemy. The Great Enemy. They are chasing us”, Dendro added. 

“Who is your Great Enemy?” Jake asked. 

“The Venthum”, Dendro said sternly. 

“The Venthum? Jake responded immediately. 

Dendro paused for a moment as they continued to zoom thousands of feet above the Earth below.

“They are the ancient enemy of Naronia, and Naronian society. Our cultures have clashed for millennia. There have been tragic wars. Millions of lives lost. We have witnessed the entire destruction of planets. The Venthum disturb the peace of the Universe to pursue their darker visions. They believe in control. They believe in the artificial manipulation of life. They believe love and compassion to be the weakest forces in the Universe. They believe in the prosperity of their race, and the destruction of others not like them. Most importantly, they are the true enemies of the Ld’Shab.”

“What is this Ld’Shab?” Jake asked, his heart pounding.

“It is the central religious and philosophical field of study in Naronia. Its influence is far reaching across The Nestomir, and even beyond it.”, Dendro responded.

Jake stared at the unnerving looking alien symbols on Dendro’s back.

“Why are The Venthum enemies to this religion, your philosophy”? Jake asked.

“They believe in fighting against the core rhythms of nature. Our societal forefathers believed in learning from nature, not fighting it. They believe in unnaturally leveraging The Learning Force.”, Dendro replied.

Different thoughts ran through Jake’s mind. The conversation reminded him of things he learned about in history class. The common thread of different cultures fighting one another, sometimes, without clear motives.

“The Learning Force?” Jake asked.

“The Utma”, said Dendro.

“Why are you on Earth?” Jake asked.

“We were attacked in The Larhadian Belt. As I mentioned before, I am a Tier Two Solar Forces Pilot. I am, well how do you translate it, there is a complex class structure on Naronia. The three-tiered class structure is reflected through all parts of society. Draconians are on the second rung in Naronian Society. As Tier Two Pilots, our emergency capsules are almost useless in battle emergencies. There is a joke amongst other Tier II operatives that the only difference between Tier 1 operatives and Tier 2 operatives is that in emergencies we pray harder.”, Dendro said.

“That’s messed up”, Jake mused. 

“It’s complicated, and it stems from thousands of years of ruling class history and voluntary and forced immigration and emigration throughout The Nestomir.”, Dendro remarked.

Dendro continued, "The principal ruling family on Naronia are the Affagi. They are of an ancient race, called The Mentosi. They are the only native intelligent sentient race of Naronia. The Affagi have ruled over all of the Naronian species and societal classes for fifteen hundred years”.

Jake was listening intently.

“The power structure on Naronia is divided into two groups: The Solar Senate, and The Naronian Council. All power on our planet is situated between these parties. I am a member of the Solar Forces, the Naronian Military Arm, as a Second-Tier Operative and pilot”, Dendro imparted. 

“The Solar Forces is the core military power for the Republic of Naronia. Our crew was on a mission to explore a cluster of unidentified ships spotted forty million kilometers off the edge of the Naronian space jurisdiction perimeter in The Larhadian Asteroid Belt. These unidentified ships were giving off Lithium-Radar definitions that signified to our intelligence teams on Naronia that there was an eighty-seven percent chance they were Stealth Grade Venthum III Battle Cruisers.

The social hierarchies within Naronian culture are an unfortunate but very real occurrence. The first set of Dark Wars, which concluded over ten thousand years ago, is when our Draconian home planet, Draconia, was destroyed. The decision to destroy our mother planet was made by the precursor to The Naronian Council, The Naronian Effectorate. 

There was a galactic war, spreading throughout The Nestomir. The Venthum tried to enslave Draconia. They believed Draconia to be a key strategic location in the galaxy to develop a military stronghold, as our mother planet was heavily stocked with crude, platinum grade rocket-coal, a core natural resource for rocket fuel.

This knowledge combined with the fact that our species has the physical strength to perform heavy labor, and shape-shift, made Draconia a key place in the galaxy to build a stronghold against Naronia.

The acting Naronian Imperial Chairman at the time, Iglod The Wise, then positioned on the now lost continent of Akrecious, recognized that he had to make a critical decision. This decision would have far reaching implications throughout history and The Nestomir.

With the Venthum threat of gaining an established stronghold dangerously close to Naronia — Iglod The Wise knew he had to act quickly. 

The relationship at the time between Naronia and Draconia was in its nascent stages. A few explorer ships visited Draconia peacefully about twelve thousand years ago. They began to explore the Draconian ecology and natural resources. The Naronian Council listed Draconia as a great place of potential exploration and excavation at the time. 

The Naronian explorers came to discover that our race possessed unique shape shifter capabilities that made us a distinguished asset to many aspects of Naronian society. It is believed our evolutionary ancestors acquired this genetic trait due to Draconia’s unique position with our star system’s two stars, the larger, called The Sun, and the smaller, we call Stella. The alignment of our two stars and the extreme rotational angle of Draconians axis of rotation caused a large flux of radiation on the surface of the planet. Scientists believed it led to a mutation which sparked a variety of others that modified our mother planet's life form’s genetic circuits, which ultimately led to what we call shape shifting potential.

This is the reason Iglod The Wise decided to save a small portion of our population and bring them to Naronia, while also destroying the planet to prevent an additional Venthum stronghold from taking place in the galaxy."

"They destroyed your entire planet, how is that possible?" Jake asked.

"Yes. It was completely obliterated. It was turned to dust using Nestomirian first generation nuclear weapons technology", replied Dendro.

"To continue, the Naronian explorers brought back a small number of our ancient ancestors to Naronia. These ancient Draconians were the only Draconians who survived the destruction of Draconia. Once they arrived in Naronia, they were slowly assimilated into society.”, Dendro explained.

Dendro took a hiatus from speaking. He continued to fly in silence. Jake mull over the story in his head.

Dendro spoke again, apparently wanting to further elaborate on his ancestral history.

“Different races have immigrated in and out of Naronia over the fourteen thousand or so years of the modern Sentient age. There is a complex galactic history, with deeply layered political systems that have been rooted and uprooted over the millenia.”

“Draconians have been considered outsiders by the other native races of Naronia. Of course, The Mentosi are the only truly native race on Naronia, but in casual speak, native refers to the races who immigrated in the early Sentient Age, like the immigration of the Locke tribes from Tarvezius.”

“The Draconian race has lived relatively well in Naronian society, but not without hardships. We have tried to educate ourselves as best possible, give our offspring economic opportunity, and develop lives of purpose. But, we are limited with the current class system. We have thrived in positions where our advantageous physical traits come into play, like the military arm of society. However, we have been severely limited in other areas of life, specifically in roles of business leadership and creative work”, said Dendro.

Jake tried to absorb the information as fast as he could so he could respond in a somewhat intelligent manner. 

“That. That is tough. The hardships, these class structures, these frustrations, seem to be omnipresent in societal systems across the known Universe. I am also sorry to hear your mother planet was destroyed.”, Jake responded, hoping not to offend Dendro.

"It was a long time ago. And thank you. But it has been thousands of years, and life is not so bad. Especially if you get the opportunity to serve in The Forces.", Dendro said in an upbeat tone.

“Did your parents encourage you to join the military?”, Jake asked. 

“Well, not exactly. I lost my father when I was young to disease. I do not remember him. My mother did encourage me to join The Forces, but she did not support my desire to be in Special Operations which is the most lethal, and most exciting part of the Solar Forces military arm.”, Dendro replied.

“That makes sense. I can’t even imagine telling my mother I want to join the military.”, Jake replied.

“Does she check in with you often?”, Jake asked.

“I lost my mother when I was seventeen”, Dendro responded. 

“Oh. I am sorry. ”, Jake said, not expecting that response.

They continued to soar.

Jake was lost in his thoughts for quite a while as they continued to fly at a breakneck velocity. Jake imagined Dendro's alien world, Naronia, with its different races living together. It made him think of the fantasy books he read in his childhood. How could any of this be true? It had to be, unless it was a dream because he certainly felt himself flying above his planet, soaring on top of a speaking dragon-creature, who seemed to be as intelligent, if not more, than himself.  

Jake wasn't sure how fast they were going, but it must have been extremely fast, as the terrain below them now had shifted from the fertile plains of the midwest, to a much more mountainous geography...maybe the Rockies? Or the Sierra Nevada?

Jake saw a few flashes of lightning ripping through the stratosphere not too far off in the distance. 

Then, a large gust of wind hit them, pushing them temporarily into a sixty-degree angle. Dendro wrestled them back into a more balanced position, but appeared to be struggling greatly with the change in atmospheric conditions. Jake’s stomach lurched.

“Oh, ####”, Dendro said, in a low, grumble of a voice. The flight became increasingly more rocky. Dendro was changing his altitude and flight angle at a rapid pace.

Rain started pouring down. First, it was just a thick foggy mist and a drizzle, but then the rain started to come down hard. Very hard. And not just from the top. But sideways as well. 

Groans of thunder began to shake the mass of air around them. Lightning began to zip about a quarter mile out in the distance. Closer than before. Dendro began to wobble back and forth, moving his giant brownish-black scaled wings to the pattern of the gusts of wind to keep them stable. The alien markings on Dendro’s hide and scales lit up bright as they reflected the bullying lightning pulses.

"Jake, we are in trouble. I can not fly in stratospheric storms of this intensity. We must get to your Earth's city of Seattle; it's the only location I see with an antenna-like structure that I can use to boost my emergency communication signal. I must send my coordinates back to the Solar Forces classified base.”

“My GPS is showing me that Seattle, Washington, contains a tower that I will need to phone back to the primary Solar Forces ship grouping in the Atmosphera system, which is our emergency meeting point, about sixty light-years from the Larhadian Belt. My Lithium-Radar can not send a signal that far by itself. We must get a proper boost.”

The invisible shield around them was not as invincible as Jake thought. A higher intensity of air, and rain pellets began to hit his face. The storm was clearly affecting the shields ability to traverse their voices to one another.

Dendro raised his voice.

“We can get proper instructions on how to get home if we can get in touch with my base. The Venthum are not far behind us. They did not trace us leaving, or else we would already be dead.”, Dendro stated.

Larger splurts of wet rain hit Jake’s face. He squinted to maintain visibility through the storm.

"I need you to stabilize my flight parameters for this unexpected stratospheric storm. We still have about two hours of flight time. It’s too much flight time to take the risk of not updating our flight parameters.”, Dendro said.

"What do I need to do"? Jake shouted as it was now hard to communicate in the storm, the air exploding around them, and the rain muffling the reach of his voice.

“I did not expect this. But you will need to complete the Utma Benefit Teaching of Chester Eclaire, to gain the Utma Generated Benefit of Flight Based Storm Control.

“Hmm, I hope I remember the tale”, Dendro said. 

“Please pay close attention. These lessons get slightly more difficult as you proceed in your Benefit Teachings. This lesson also comes in the form of a tale. It begins like this”.

“Chester Eclairé sat on his Tarvezian birchwood rocking chair which was passed down from his great grandfather. He peered out into the distance. He could see Star System A's two stars, The Sun and Stella, lingering on the horizon.

Chester savored this time on his porch. The sight of the pine trees surrounding his house elevated his state of being. He breathed in the smell of the freshly sprouted carrots that his wife planted in the garden. He relished the view of his two dogs, Kimbo, and Jimmy, running around the yard, barking at one another, fighting over a bone.

Chester Eclairé was already considered an enlightened thinker of The Nestomir's Industrial Age. After graduating from the Tarvezian Technical Institute with a Ph.D in Solid State Physics, he joined their ranks as a Physics professor. He gained recognition in the academic world after publishing a paper on the superconducting properties of Ithium.

"Here you go Chesty", Elma said, as she placed a large glass of yellow creative elixir in the hands of her other half. Chester's wife's lemonade was the only edible item that enabled Chester to augment the access he had to his own grey matter. He took an ambitious swig.

Chester's new research centered on electric motors. He recently received a grant to start his own research laboratory on campus. He spent most of his time thinking about tungsten coils, magnetic fields, and rotating objects. His team's newest electric motor design was being tested for its ability to be used as a drastically more efficient heating pump for the dorms at the University.

But today, as he sat on his porch and looked at the trees, his revving mind was not focused on motors. It was focused on Silicon. He received a letter in the mail not two days ago from his old university friend, Jasper Tinthus, who was a material scientist at the Alhambra Institute, a university in the Tarvezian province of Nekria. 

Jasper and Chester often exchanged letters about a new trend buzzing in academia: computational machines. The topic was not new to them however. 

Chester picked up the letter. Old, precious memories jettisoned through him.

Jasper and Chester met in their Philosophy course their sophomore year at the Tarvezian Institute. Their professor was giving a lecture on Zenshi Hedoku, a famous Naronian philosopher, who lived and died over a thousand years prior. Their professor gave a summary of Zenshi Hedoku's analysis of the First Ancients. He spoke about Zenshi's analysis of the First Ancients' ideas on political structures, economics, and medicine, as well as more off-beat topics like computational machines and flying devices. 

The two were sitting side by side, and they simultaneously noticed that they were both sketching down questions about the nature of computational machines.

"Hey man, are you thinking about those devices Zenshi was studying, the computational things?", Chester had asked Jasper, looking at Jasper’s notebook sketch of a faucet. 

“Yes, they intrigue me, but I do not know what to make of them. Doesn’t seem our professor has any interesting input on them either”, said Jasper.

The two chuckled.

Conversations in class spouted into friendship. They split their days working on their physics assignments in the library and sitting in the Philosophy courtyard discussing the works of some of the most powerful minds in history.

Chester glared at the letter from his dear friend as he sat on his porch.

"Chester, I thought you might find this interesting. It seems a research assistant in one of our laboratories noted down that the element Silicon has some interesting properties." — Best, Jasper

Chester pulled up a second piece of paper behind Jasper's letter. He examined it. Jasper had highlighted a specific line of text written by the research assistant.

"The element is not particularly interesting except for the fact when different silicon blocks are spiked with Phosphorus or Boron they exhibit some interesting electrical properties. However I do not have the expertise to understand it. It also seems to be an ideal candidate for making new jewelry due to its beautiful shining appearance....". 

The article went on to talk about Silicon's heating properties. Chester examined the article closely. He paid attention to the first highlighted sentence. Silicon sometimes conducted electricity, and sometimes it did not, when it was chopped into different blocks and spiked with other elements.

He turned his head towards the pine trees. He recollected how he often mentioned to Jasper that the scientists of the day continued to struggle with shrinking down of mechanical gates to power  computational machines. The idea of using clunky mechanical switches never made sense to Chester. They were too big. They weren't practical.

He thought about Zenshi's faucet. Then he thought about the modern day struggles to create a smaller, less clunky, switch. 
`;

const ChapterThree2 = `"Wait.", Chester shouted out loud. 

He ran down to his basement. He had a workshop here. He opened his new Cabinet of Elements which was gifted to him by his wife for his birthday. He threw some silicon, phosphorus, boron, and two batteries on the table. 

He used his slice cutter and element injection machine to create different shaped blocks infused with different combinations of elements. He used his electrical engineering expertise to configure the battery terminals to different ends of the silicon blocks. 

Twelve hours later, covered in sut, smelling of grime. He had it. The Nestomir's first transistor.
`;

const ChapterThree3 = `“Chesty, is that you making all that noise?”, Elma said as she walked into the workshop. 

“Oh my, what, what are you doing?”, she asked him as she saw him covered in glue and muck. 

“Elmy, I got it. This...this is what we need. A faucet. An electrical faucet, but one that can be controlled entirely with electricity. No moving parts!", he turned toward his wife who looked at him with affection.”

“That is the tale I learned many years ago. Please, Jake, get to the Utma Meditative State and complete the Benefit Challenge.”, Dendro yelled through the storm.

Jake closed his eyes.  The light reddish yellow fuzz in the corner of the front of his thoughts brought him back to the dock. He was back again.

“Jeez!”, he thought.

He called out “Any one there”.

The large yellow text illuminated above the ocean water.


YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE LESSON OF CHESTER ECLAIRE.
 
THIS CHALLENGE TESTS THY UNDERSTANDING.
 
ACCORDING TO CHESTER ECLAIRE’S SKETCH OF THE NESTOMIR’S FIRST TRANSISTOR, WHICH METAL PRONG SERVES AS THE SWITCH?
 
 
Jake shivered with relief. His mechanical mind had paid attention to the lesson. He knew the answer.  

“It is prong number two. The metal rod coming out of the center of the transistor. I remember that when electricity is sent through this prong, it opens the gate. Thus, it acts as the switch. I also know this ability, to toggle electrical current, with nothing more than another electrical signal is what makes the transistor so unique.”

 
UTMA BENEFIT TEACHING COMPLETE. STORM CONTROL BENEFIT ATTAINED. 
 
NO FURTHER ACTION NEEDED.


The scene began to zoom out again quickly. The ocean, the sky, the graphic, he was whirling through, turned into nothing. Then his eyes opened. And he could see Dendro again.

“I nailed that one,” Jake said coolly. 

“That was excellent”, Dendro replied.

“Ahhhhhhhhh No, ####”. 

“Not again, ####!”

Jake’s upper right arm was burning. 

He pulled his sleeve up, and saw another fresh marking. 

“You now have access to implement Storm Control at any time, through the Utma Meditative State. 

They were now wobbling a bit, but the ride was smoother. A dramatic improvement was added. It was a great relief to both of them. 

“Nice job my Earthling friend”, said Dendro, who began to beat his wings in a more powerful fashion, causing them to rise in altitude.

“Why are we going so high up?” asked Jake. 

“This is where us Draconians think best. Up, up in the air. It’s clearer up here. Look Jake. We are approaching Seattle. You can see below.”, Denro said.

Jake looked down and could see the faint impression of the glittering lights of a large city. Seattle. It looked relatively beautiful from above. At this altitude you could still see mountains off in the distance.

Jake didn’t know much about Seattle except that the football team The Seahawks played here and that it rained a lot. He was also pretty sure Starbucks was created here as well. The Pacific Northwest was relatively alien to him.

“We must get to the top of the Space Needle. It is currently 3 am local time. We only have a few more hours with the cover of darkness. And even now the city is busy. We are going to need a plan to get this done with the least risk possible”, Dendro said.

“My wings must be touching the needle when we send the signal. And to send the signal, I will need a surge of electricity to help project it deep into outer-space. Something with an enormous voltage capacity.”, said Dendro.

Jake was befuddled. 

“Lightning.”, said Dendro. 

“Lightning”, Jake responded.

Dendro continued to gently pulse his wings as they hovered above the sparkling city.

“Lightning has to hit the tower while you take the portable network receiver and hit the “COMMS BOOST” button at the exact moment the lightning strikes the tower. You must press this button at the same time the lightning strikes the needle while I’m touching it. 

“Are you kidding me?”, said Jake. 

“No, this is the only feasible way, and I have played through over a thousand Lithium Radar suggestions on our flight here, said Dendro.

You must acquire your next Utma Benefit. This benefit is called Comms Control. The Lessons is CSS II. You must demonstrate a knowledge of utilizing divider sections to style grouped elements.

To do this, try determining	 figure out how to style all of our body sections in one grouped box that possesses any type of blue background color. We don’t have time. I need to go now. You have all the information you need. This is the next Utma benefit teaching which grants us access to the communication boost networking benefit.

A small slot opened in the back of Dendro, and something resembling a laptop slid out. 

“Take the Portable Network Receiver. Your fingerprint is now authenticated.” 

“How am I gonna do this?!”, Jake yelled loudly at Dendro, as adrenaline rushed through every crevice of his body. Jake stared down at the city below, as Dendro began a slow descent.

“You’re going to have to figure it out. I have to get us down on the ground. I can not hear well when I am diving. Hold on tight.”

Zoom. The dragon began to dive at something like an eighty five degree angle towards the foot of the city.  

This was much scarier than their climb. Jake was hanging for his dear life onto Dendro. His body still felt oddly secure. The invisible force keeping him safely attached to the Draconian’s saddle. Jake kept the portable network receiver closed and pressed up against his chest as he pressed up against the sharp, thick, scales on Dendro’s hide.

The city of Seattle was growing closer and closer. The city went from a radiating spectrum of lights, to a vast plot of land, apartment buildings and moving vehicles. He felt like he was playing one of his space fighter video games.

Dendro continued his dive. 

Jake was on the verge of hurling, and the tension in his shoulders reminded him of wakeboarding on the back of a fast moving motor boat, which he used to do during the Grapefield summers. 

It was not clear how big Seattle was from this angle. It stretched from its bright center, and radiated out in different patches way off into the distance up against the mountains it was famous for being situated up against. Jake could see a large sports arena, and a few skyscrapers very close by. They were beautiful buildings and structures all around them. There was also a giant ferris wheel spinning on the ground below. Dendro’s body was rotating slightly through the dive, and this added to the intensity of the lights and structures pouring in and out of Jake’s vision.

After about thirty seconds, Dendro finally began to stabilize his controlled fall. They were now in forty-five degree dive aiming directly towards the Space Needle.

From up high a few minutes ago, it seemed like a long silver toothpick sticking out of the ground. As they got closer it began to appear as it really was, a six hundred and five foot needle gleaming in the air above Seattle. 

“How close are you going to get!?” Jake yelled to Dendro.

“Close. I must examine it.”, Dendro rebutted.

They were now in the ballpark of one hundred feet and closing to the top of the Space Needle. Dendro leveled off his dive and began circling the structure.

The needle was gigantic up close. It was a thick, intimidating, herculean structure of metal. Jake imagined it was the size and shape of some Greek God’s spear. 

Jake glanced up and down the gigantic steel beams. He locked onto the structure with raw amazement at the epic proportions of the metallic construction. Its curvature, shape, and size, were so precisely defined by its makers. How can we build such objects? Jake’s thoughts dipped through the engineering tunnels of his mind. How can some beings spend their time bullying others, while others erect things that effectively prove the almost magical potential of man? Jake imagined eating at the top of it.

“I will have to figure out a way to stand while my wings grip the Needle securely. I am worried that if I land directly on the antennae section — it could vibrate the structure and cause catastrophic damage. From experience, it would be much wiser to land on the mid section of the tower and climb up.

“Climb up!”, shouted Jake.

“Yes, I will have to climb up slowly and carefully from the mid section. I must do it with the cover of night. I will drop you off on Harrison Street, in the back of The Museum for Pop Culture. You will have proper cover and a clear view of the tower as I am climbing.”

“Implement the code I told you. I do not have time to walk you through the details. I know this must sound bonkers Jake but we have no other option.”

Dendro gyrated his head back and forth as he scanned the sky. 

“It will leverage the same fundamentals we already went over. I am going to drop you off then fly a short distance to the base of the tower. It may take some time but keep your eyes on the tower and whatever you do, do not lose the Receiver.”

Dendro grunted as if clearing his lungs for a few moments. 

“I will use all the power within me to create a small electrical field so that we can increase the chances that lightning strikes. I will use my Wing Lighting function to create the field. 

It will not be particularly powerful, but this is all I can do with such a limited time window. Not to mention, I strongly feel we will soon have a crew of Venthum on our trail. You will see my wings glow brighter when I begin this process. At this point, you must be patient, and you can not take your eyes off me. If, once, the lightning strikes, you will have to press the “COMMS BOOST” key on the receiver.”, Dendro explained.

Dendro began beating his wings and slowly levitated towards the ground. A huge cloud of dust sifted up in the air. They finally landed gently behind a massive circular structure which must have been the museum. 

Jake rolled off of Dendro’s back.

“Good luck”. , Dendro said.

“Wait.”., Jake began. 

“See you soon.”

Dendro powered his wings, dust lifting everywhere, and was rising into the night air once again.
