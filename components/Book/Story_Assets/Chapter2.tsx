const ChapterTwo1 = `The scaled dragon-like creature stared directly at Jake. Its red eyes were blinking every few moments. Its body was almost entirely covered by the burnt-black rubble. All that was visible were the creature’s tail, neck, and head. Large pieces of metal debris and charred glass lay strewn across the pit. Something large was smoking off in the distance.
 
It looks like a “#### dragon” Jake thought, as Jake’s body started to vibrate in fear. Jake was now entirely operating on adrenaline. His body told him to run, and that’s what he did. He turned and sprinted, but he immediately tripped on the rising tail of the creature, which was far longer than he realized. 
 
He fell backward and hit his head on the ground. He scraped his arms as he tried to catch his fall, and he was now bleeding slightly. The creature was letting out loud moaning sounds and grumbles as if it were confused or in pain. The dragon thing, with a large struggle, freed its powerful body from the weight of the rubble. Dust and gravel spread throughout the air. The creature stood up on its back legs and shook its body in a similar fashion that his dog Rex did when he came out of a water bath.
 
Jake could see the creature clearly now. It was the size of a full-grown grizzly bear. It had an extremely long, rigidly scaled, greenish-brown tail, with an arrow-shaped end. Most noticeable were these etched white-grey tattoos that were present across the hide on its neck, arms, and back. The face was almost identical to that of a dragon. The creature had penetrating red eyes and a long, scaled snout.
 
To Jake’s horror, the creature slowly lowered its enormous head towards Jake’s face until it’s golf-ball sized nostrils were up against his face. It gave a massive snort, then a succession of smaller snorts. It then pulled its head back, and to Jakes's enormous surprise, it murmured “smells like shit”. Some smoke proceeded to come out of the creature’s nose, causing Jake to cough loudly. 
 
“What the ####” Jake thought to himself. How could this creature speak English? Jake backpedaled away from the creature. He was ready to run again. He sniffed his pits briefly to check his smell. But the creature came back and slowly mumbled “what is your name?”, in a deep, roar of a voice.
 
“JJJJake”, Jake said. He had forgotten his name momentarily.
 
“Jakee” the creature snarled. More smoke poured out of its nose. Its voice had a smokey hissing sound, but it wasn’t necessarily combative.
 
“Yes”, Jake replied…”whatt...are...you?” Jake asked.
 
“Whatt amm I? I am a...it paused for a second as if to think…..“I am a Naronian Draconod.” said the creature.
 
“What?”, Jake asked with extreme tension in his voice. 
 
The creature seemed to shake its head for a second as if it had water in its ears. “That’s better”, it exclaimed, with an oddly humanesque form of emotion.
 
Jake noticed some more odd markings on the dragon-like creature's wings as the creature stood up momentarily. They appeared to be weird looking, alien markings.
 
“Our Delta One Death Cruiser. It was hit. Our captain. He lost control. We went into a full tumble. We were ambushed. The Larhadian Asteroid Belt. Venthum. Three million eight hundred light years away. They knew we were coming...someone...someone gave us up?", the creature said as it looked up at the sky.
 
"How can this be?", the creature continued staring at the evening sky.
 
"We lost our right-wing.”, he blurted out in apparent mental anguish.
 
“In red-alert emergencies, Solar Forces Tier Two Draconian Pilots are only given a private ejection capsule with one light-year worth of fuel. It's a death sentence, almost.", the creature said to him as it turned to stare at Jake.
 
Jake paused for a second. He began to feel extremely dizzy.
 
"Wha, why, why, are you talking to me? I don't know what this is or where I am. I think I'm sick. I need my mom. Mom! I am hallucinating! I have been playing too many video games. Never again. I swear!", Jake said in terror as he closed his eyes waiting for something, or someone to wake him up from this dream.
 
He reopened his eyes, and nothing had changed. The alien dragon was still standing right in front of him.
 
"Venthum. They are cunning. My compatriots. My ship. I must get back. I do not understand how I ended up over three million light-years away. The Belt. It is not possible. How? How is this possible?", the creature said as it looked at the dirt and pondered momentarily.
 
"I only had one light-year worth of fuel," the creature said in a robust and low voice. 
 
The creature looked at him with intrigue. 
 
"It's no matter now. I remember seeing this planet on my Lithium-Radar. It was listed as a potentially inhabitable planet when I first ejected from our cruiser. Lithium Radar had detected solid ground with adequate nitrogen atmospheric levels for my fire-gills. But it was much too far to reach without an interstellar boost. I was paying attention to closer landing points in my space vicinity. There were a few stray asteroid belts within fifty parsecs of my previous location.” the creature said.
 
“It is impossible that I got here with one light year's worth of fuel”, the creature repeated again.
 
The creature paused for a moment.
 
“I do not understand. I am not even sure precisely where I am. One second.", the creature said, as it closed its eyes. “This certainly was not where I intended to end up.”, the creature exclaimed.
 
"Earth, you are on Earth," Jake said. 
 
"Erth?. Interesting name, hmm. Which system?", it asked.
 
"Uh." Jake wished he had paid more attention to astronomy. "The Milky Way?"
 
"Milky Way..hmm...no I have not heard of this. I am reviewing my Lithium Radar flight log. One moment, yes. I believe I am in what our ancestors termed the Nilofar System -- Eta Omega. We are in a spiroid galaxy, of some sort, one of its outer arms. Let me check. Yes. That is correct. This makes no sense to me. I am baffled.”, it replied.
 
"How...how, how do you speak English?!, Jake exclaimed, feeling sick. He was still trembling and thinking of sprinting for his life again. The early evening sky was shifting into the darker night.
 
"Our Draconian forefathers mapped these far eastern systems many years ago. We have evolved over thousands of years to interpret language and dialects based on a wave signal all life forms give off, called the Utma. That's how I can speak your tongue."
 
"So you..you are an alien?" Jake asked with wonder.
 
"I guess that's what you'd call it. Although, on my home planet, many races are treated as aliens. Even though we immigrated to Naronia, a planet in The Nestomir Galaxy, multiple millennia ago.”
 
"Naronia?", Jake asked, not expecting the word to come out his mouth.
 
"Yes. Though my ancestors are from a planet called Draconia, which was destroyed thousands of years ago. In the early Sentient Age. I must get out of here. They are coming — the Venthum. Yes, I can see. Look up there. That is not a star. That is a Deathcruiser. I must move. We must move.", the creature uttered.
 
"Whattt? Who is coming? Death Cruiser?!" yelled Jake, his voice still trembling.
 
"We must leave now. Now. If you want to live, get on my back. Actually, if we want to live, get on my back. I can not fly long distance atmospheric trips alone. I need a commanding pilot.”, the creature said.
 
"Now!" the dragon-creature snorted as Jake jumped a foot in the air.
 
"Get on my back," said the creature as it lay partially sideways to allow Jake to climb on his dark green and brown scaled hide. The star in the sky was getting brighter. Jake wasn't sure if he fell too hard and was in a dream (or a nightmare). However, this Draconian monster seemed sincere about his concern about this Death Cruiser.
 
Jake decided he had no choice. Running through the maze corn field chased by angry aliens coming out of a battleship seemed worse than getting a ride on a crazy dragon thing's back. He hesitantly stepped onto the alien. 
 
He positioned himself on a scaled apparatus that seemed almost like a saddle built into the creature's body. He put his hands on the two protruding scales that felt and looked like handles. 
 
Then something unexpected happened. A large square portion of the Dragon's back slid down and tucked itself underneath another layer of its hide. And what appeared was unimaginable. A screen. Some kind of color screen.
 
“Listen carefully to what I say.”, Dendro said sternly.
 
“You must acquire your first Utma Benefit, right here, right now, for us to live. I don’t have time to explain everything, not even close. But recognize that the military systems from my home planet, Naronia, use Utma Generated Super Powers, or Utma Benefits, to fuel most of our military capabilities”, Dendro said. 
 
“What the #### is an Utma Benefit?”, Jake shouted out.
 
“One moment, let me finish.”, Dendro said.
 
“Jake recognize that our culture practices an ancient philosophy, known as Ld’Shab, which is derived from our appreciation, study, and worship of The Learning Force, The Utma.”, Dendro said. 
 
“Ld’Shab?”, Jake sputtered out-loud?
 
“Yes. And through our long history studying The Utma, we’ve learned that she incentivizes us to learn specific subjects she feels will better society long term.”
 
“Five hundred years ago we discovered the existence of physically tangible Utma Benefits. They are physical benefits we use to the military's advantage.”
 
“All Utma Benefits are tied to a distinct Utma Benefit Teaching. When a soldier needs to access an Utma Benefit, that soldier must receive the respective Benefit Teaching, and solve the respective Utma Benefit Challenge. The challenge is an exercise that demonstrates the soldiers knowledge of the subject matter.
 
“I’m dreaming. This is crazy.”, Jake said.
 
“No, you are not dreaming. Now let me continue. Our Ld’Shab spiritual teachers work vigorously with military leaders to determine what lessons need to be taught, how they need to be taught, and how leaders need to think about each respective Utma Challenge. For example, what behaviors and thought processes must be demonstrated by a pupil to be considered a successful learner in the eyes of The Utma? Thousands of years of knowledge, testing, and evolution have gone into deriving this sacred knowledge pool. 
 
Dendro looked up at the stars above. The large white dot was getting brighter. Dendro curled his scaled head back around. Jake had a discombobulated look on his face. 
 
“You must still be lost. Here.”, Dendro paused briefly, contemplating his verbiage.
 
“We don’t have much time, minutes even, but I think it’s important to provide you with a tiny bit more context so that you have a chance of absorbing these lessons extremely quickly”, Dendro said, as he took a deep inhalation of air.
 
“Ld’Shab philosophy strongly believes that The Utma exists to guide our learning process so we can better our world. We believe that an intelligent being's purpose is to learn. Learning is our ultimate goal, as both individuals and as collective species. And more specifically, Ld’Shab believes life’s purpose is to learn with purpose. In our native tongue, the term for learning with purpose is known as Latisvha”.
 
“It’s essential to understand that Naronian society evolved and developed a Network, much like your Internet. They are nearly identical. Products, businesses, and all sorts of services run digitally over our Network, in the Nestomir Galaxy. Without The Network, our society would be crippled. We depend on it the same way The Milky Way does. For business, for networking, for logistics, military operations, and communication. It is essential to modern life.
 
Although The Network has its downsides, like the 18.7 septillion cat photos shared each day across our galaxy, it still has a glorious capability to enhance communication and collaboration amongst the living species in The Nestomir.
 
Society has begun to learn that The Learning Force, The Utma, has an intrinsic desire for her intelligent species to learn about computing and networking. Five hundred years ago we learned that she actually incentivizes us to do so through the Utma Benefits. 
 
“Does any of this make sense Jake?”, Dendro asked.
 
“I think so. Sounds a little….wacky.” Jake responded.
 
“First time hearing that, yes it does. And also, Jake, recognize, the Utma exists for you as much as it does for me. We are all a part of the same Universe”. Dendro added.
 
“If you say so”, Jake replied.
 
“I think that was good enough to get started...OK. Now where were we?”, Dendro said.
 
“Right. Yes. To complete a long distance atmospheric flight, a Tier II Draconian Solar Forces Pilot must possess a commanding pilot who has acquired the Utma Benefit of Basic Flight.” Dendro said.  
 
“The Utma Benefit of Basic Flight is tied to one of the Ld’Shab foundational Benefit Teachings called Computers as Mechanisms. It is effectively an introduction to how computational engines work.” Dendro said. 
 
“Let’s begin, and listen carefully. I have not been trained as a teacher. But every military operative in the forces knows the core lessons, well enough. My memory of the lessons will have to do, for now.”, Dendro said.
 
“Let’s begin with Computers as Mechanisms, ☍♄♄♂☍♄♄ ☍♄♄☍♄♄, pronounced Complacia Eta’ Metezmo, in our native tongue.
 
“This lesson first starts with us closing our eyes and asking ourselves: why do we even use computers? The intelligent might say that we use computers to leverage the speed of light. The very wise will say that we use computers to leverage the speed of light to process information. 
 
What does that even mean? And what is "information" exactly? Well, let's step back for a second, and recognize a computer for what it is: a mechanism.
 
“You’re talking about the computers on my planet as well? My phone even?”, Jake asked.
 
“Yes, these are all computational devices. They are most certainly computers”, Dendro responded.
 
Dendro continued with The Teaching.
 
“So, why is a computer a mechanism? Because computers accomplish their information processing needs by arranging a specific set of parts, that each perform a separate function, to cut, mix, chop, slice, splice, and convert information into its desired form. This interrelated series of separate parts working together is a mechanism.
 
“But what is a mechanism, really? Let's take a look at the esoteric definition from an Earth based search engine.”
 
"A device that transforms input forces and movement into a desired set of output forces and movement." — Wikipedia
 
“That sounds about right. This definition alludes to a mechanism in its more “old school“ physically observable form. A splendid example of this type of mechanism is an Earth bicycle. We have similar devices in The Nestomir. A bicycle mechanism enables Earthlings to transform the energy stored in their legs into the rotational energy of the wheels of their bikes.
 
Another example of a mechanism is the differential on the axles of your car. Have you ever wondered how your mom pulled off that left turn onto Barley Street? It's actually impossible to turn left when you think about it.”
 
“Wait, wait? What are you talking about man? It’s not possible to turn left?”, Jake said instinctively.
 
“No Jake, it’s not possible with one straight axle. This is because as your car turns left, the left wheels are turning through a shorter turning radius than the outer wheels. This means the left wheels must spin slower than the wheels on the right side of the car! If that's always the case when you turn, and note this applies in either direction, how can one metal rod connect both wheels together, while spinning at two different velocities at the same time? It can't! That's not possible. Actually, you could try it, but you would start to feel one of the wheels scrubbing on the ground in an incredibly uncomfortable fashion. At high speed, or during a tight turn, you might even witness your axle break in half.”
 
Jake thought for a moment. “I guess, yea, well, I never thought of that, wait so..”.
 
“To solve this problem, earth engineers came up with a design for the Automotive Differential. This mechanism employs an ingenious combination of planetary gears and pinions to enable a car's wheels to spin at different (angular) velocities.
 
“I am about to project a hologram in the air, which is a super power I’ve gained through my Utma Benefit training. Dendro shifted his neck slightly. 
`;

const ChapterTwo2 = `“Woah!”, Jake screamed as a light beam rendered a high resolution visual in the air. A real hologram. It seemed to come out of Dendro’s back. Jack examined the image for a moment.
 
“That’s super cool”, Jake said.
 
“Your human knee is another excellent example of a mechanism. However, this mechanism wasn't designed by you exactly, it was designed by evolution. The knee joint consists of a series of links (bones and tendons) and pivot points (the locations where the tendons connect to bone, as well as the knee joint itself) that connect together to enable your knee to operate along a wide and predictable range of motion.
`;

const ChapterTwo3 = `The design of your knee mechanism also allows your quadricep muscle to benefit from mechanical leverage. Mechanical leverage takes advantage of the fact the laws of physics allow us to amplify the force of the opposing side of a lever arm, as we move further away from the pivot point. In return, the force generator on the initial side of the lever (in this case, the quadricep muscle) has to engage in a longer arc of motion to move the object the same distance. We can dramatically increase the force our foreleg can overcome. This is often an excellent exchange. We can now move something much larger, although it will take us a little longer to do so.
`;

const ChapterTwo4 = `As we study physical mechanisms it becomes apparent that we (or nature) can bestow the knowledge of the universe's physical laws to solve a problem in a more efficient fashion.
 
The more efficient part is very important to note. For example, when we study the bicycle, it's critical that we are cognizant of the problem you were initially trying to solve. The problem humans attempted to solve with the creation of the bicycle is the inefficiency of human movement.
 
You have a lot of energy stored in your leg muscles, but your feet can't slide on normal surfaces. Thus, when you walk, or run, you continually expend energy to speed up and slow down your legs. You are extremely inefficient with your stored leg energy.
 
A bicycle mechanism enables you to transfer the energy stored in your leg muscles to the wheels of the bike. More technically, you convert the chemical energy stored in your leg's muscle cells into the angular kinetic energy of the bike's wheels. You are able to utilize your knowledge of the universe's physical laws, such as Conservation of Energy, and Conservation of Momentum, to build a more efficient solution to your human movement problem. You could survive without bikes, but your ability to traverse longer distances would be limited. Mechanisms improve our ability to augment society, create new experiences for intelligent beings, and deliver positive value.
 
It's also important to recognize just how different hyper intelligent beings are with respect to other living things in either of our galaxies, when it comes to our desire to experience new things. For instance, an Earth tiger eats, sleeps, mates, and can enjoy a relatively satisfying life as long as its core needs are met. Those needs don't change much, if at all, from generation to generation. A human being, however, needs travel, knowledge, new toys, new gizmos, education, culture, sports, relationships, dance, music..you get the point. Our minds desire new ways to experience new things. And these needs change dramatically over time and over generations.
 
“That is true”, Jake said.
 
“This brings me back to computers. Computers enable us to push forward the speed and efficiency of the calculations we've already been performing on paper, but they also allow us to create completely new experiences. So computers are a multi-faceted mechanism in this sense (they achieve more than one purpose).
 
It's also important to visualize that from an evolutionary standpoint, both of our species went from the desire to move heavy things, to a desire to process information and move heavy things. For example, not so long ago it was a great feat to build the modern forklift, which helps humans move extremely heavy objects with ease. But today you demand much more. You need the forklift’s lifting capabilities, but you also want the forklift to run an algorithm which detects its ideal pneumatic settings based on a variety of temperature and job inputs. It has to get smarter. It has to process information.
 
But what is information? Well, information is information. It's data. It's instructions. It's used for communication. It's that which is communicated. At an instinctual level, it's a way to coordinate where a food source is located, the ability to remember that, and convey it to another member of your hunting tribe. That may take a map, or a verbal description. Information is the genetic code that provides the physiological instructions on how to make you. Information is also the 0's and 1's that make up your modern day Netflix stream. This is all information. It’s always been here.
 
But computers aren't here for information. They are here to store it, process it, and move it elsewhere, quickly.
 
Before modern computers, we processed calculations by hand. We stored information on paper. We delivered information through the physical mail.
 
Computers today speed things up. They follow complex, repeatable rules, much faster than we can, and they do it with near perfect accuracy. They store enormous quantities of information with ease. And they move information around really, really fast. They can also leverage networking and modern signaling protocols to communicate with each other.
 
But, even with all of their incredible capabilities, a computer, or a computational engine, at the end of the day, is still just a mechanism, no different than our knee, bicycle, or the differential on our car.
 
“I’m not sure I follow exactly”, Jake said.
 
“Let's take a look at an example. What I’m about to present to you is called a logical AND gate. This is a device that takes two input signals, and spits out one output signal. It’s intention is simple. It absorbs two signals, where each signal is either a YES or a NO. It then presents one output signal, which can be YES or NO. The rule for an AND gate is that it’s output should only be YES if both input signals are YES. It’s called a logical AND gate because input-a AND input-b must be YES for the output to read YES. If either or both of the inputs read NO, the output will read NO.
 
“This device you see here is an AND gate. Both rods A and B must be pressed forward for rod C to move forward. You can think of a rod pushed forward as a YES signal, and a rod pushed backward as a NO signal.
`;

const ChapterTwo5 = `“Wow, ok, that’s clever. I get it.”, Jake said.
 
“And here's another one. A logical OR gate. Only either rod A or B must be pressed for C to move forward.”, Dendro said.
`;

const ChapterTwo6 = `“I see. Simple enough. Cool.”, Jake said.
 
“Yes. These devices are known to computer scientists and electrical engineers as Logic Gates. Logic gates receive a combination of YES, NO signals, and spit out only ever one output signal. That output signal will be either YES or NO. Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of information processing. 
 
The critical point here is that when we build a logic gate, we don't need electricity, at all. In fact, we could theoretically build an entire computer using nothing but physical (non-electrical) parts, and people have done this, for fun. But these devices are not practical because they would have to be the size of a few thousand football fields to compete with the processing power of your iPhone. 
 
However, your species was lucky enough to invent the transistor. Our society independently discovered the transistor three hundred years ago. But let’s look at it from Earth’s point of view so we don’t confuse this conversation because the lesson is exactly the same.
 
Your Earthly engineers developed the transistor on December 23, 1947, in Bell Laboratories.
 
“I’ve heard of a transistor before. But I don’t know exactly what it is”, Jake said.
 
“Ok. Well, a transistor is an electrical device which toggles the flow of electrical current on, and off. That’s it. It’s incredibly simple, except it does so in a very clever fashion. Electricity enters through one side. It leaves through another. In the middle is a control gate that opens and closes, allowing electricity to flow, or not to flow. 
 
The magical essence of a transistor is that its control gate can be toggled open or shut solely by electrical voltage (another electrical signal). This means we can very easily toggle the flow of current through the transistor by running a signal to the control gate. To be more clear, when we send current towards the gate it opens, when we remove it, it closes.
`;

const ChapterTwo7 = `With the invention of the transistor, we no longer need moving parts to build our logic gates. This facet is critical to taking us into the computational age. It allowed us to exponentially decrease the size and effort of building a Logic Gate. We should also note that as you may observe, logic gates only operate by evaluating an on or off signal, or a binary signal pattern. It’s for this reason, computers speak binary. Computers only read and interpret on and offs, represented as 0’s and 1’s.  
 
The first transistor was about the size of….Jake, let me see your hand. Dendro checked out Jake’s hand and ran some calculation in his head.
 
“Yes, I can see it was about the same size of your closed fist.  Today, Earthlings can fit about five hundred million across the surface of a grain of sand. Naronian engineers can fit even more.
 
Now, as you might be able to see, it’s not the transistor itself that’s special. We could create a mechanical transistor. It’s nothing more than a gate that opens and closes. 
 
It is the ability for the switches control gate to toggle electrical flow through nothing more than a shift in voltage that makes it special. The material that enables this property is called a semi-conductor. It gets this name because without a voltage being applied to this material, it will not conduct electricity (thus the gate is shut). However, when we apply a voltage to this material, often Silicon, it conducts electricity, thus, opening the gate.
 
To pause for a moment, I want to stress if you've followed me to this point, you've learned an extraordinary amount. So pat yourself on the back. History, purpose, and fundamentals are key to developing greater understandings of any subject. Not to say we learned all the fundamentals, but we were introduced to a few key concepts.
 
Dendro paused for a moment.
 
“We can now use transistors to construct Logic Gates. Let’s look at how we can then build an AND gate with two transistors.
`;

const ChapterTwo8 = `In order for Output O to receive the electrical current from Voltage Source, both transistor gates must be open. In order for this to happen, both I1 and I2 must send an electrical current to their gate. 
 
We can build an OR gate with two transistors set up in this fashion.
`;

const ChapterTwo9 = `So now you can visualize how the building blocks of a computer are simple mechanisms. 
 
Now let's transition slightly and talk a little bit about this thing everybody talks about: Code.
 
What is code? Why do these beard rocking, espresso drinking, beaning encompassing, boot wearing software developers even write code? Well, as I think you know, it's to give the computer instructions it understands. But if the computer is just a mechanism, as we described before, how can it understand something?
 
Dendo’s hologram illuminated the night air again.
 
“I'm displaying an extremely simple program coded in Python, a popular coding language used both on Earth and in The Nestomir. The program adds 1 and 2 together, saves that value to a place in its memory called “sum”, and then displays the value of sum to the screen. Let's take a simplified view of what happens to achieve this goal.
`;

const ChapterTwo10 = `So what happens? Well, two programs work together, called a compiler and an interpreter, to parse the Python code and translate it into machine code. This happens through a series of steps. Machine code is instructions written in the language the computer hardware can absorb and directly act on. Machine code is almost always written in binary. These 0s’ and 1’s are a direct representation of your Python code’s instructions. 
 
The translated binary will then enter your computer’s CPU (central processing unit). With respect to our Python program here, the CPU will recognize that it needs to add two numbers together, so it will locate an adding mechanism somewhere in its series of transistors and logic gates, to perform the adding operation. This adding mechanism, as we described, will utilize the only tools the computer has, logic gates, transistors, and memory slots. 
`;

const ChapterTwo11 = `The CPU will also recognize it needs to save the result of the addition in memory. It then runs the binary representations of 2, which is 10 (binary), and 3, which is 11 (binary), which were translated during compilation, and then runs them through the adding mechanism it has partitioned. The CPU then directs the binary result of the addition to a place in memory called “sum”. In our case there would be 101 (5 in base 10). It then receives the binary instructions to display 101 (binary) the visual representation of SUM to the screen. 
 
That’s it. Well. From an extremely simplified view, that’s it.
 
“When I first learned programming I consistently asked myself how does the information in my Python file "get built back up" so I can see it on my screen once it's processed? But this was a fundamental misinterpretation for how computers work. Everything is compiled down to machine language of 0’s and 1’s, and it remains that way. The computer only ever operates here. 
 
We know this is true because there are only transistors at the lowest level of the device. There is nothing else. When we see something on our screen, the screen is wired up to somewhere where the results of the processing occurred, like a memory slot that stores binary information. The display then paints the screen so you see the numbers in english, etc. Do not confuse the pixels you are viewing with the language the computer is using to function.
 
Engineers use source code to gain leverage over the binary system. We could learn how to program in 0's and 1's, and in certain cases we do, but in most scenarios, it's infinitely faster to use code, unless we're modifying the deepest, most fundamental layers of the computer, which often to not need to be touched (adding will stay the same) until something like quantum computing comes along.
 
Another great question that can sometimes stump the best of us, is what compiles the compiler? It’s true, every program is run using machine code, including the same program we use to translate our python file into machine language. Just understand, our computer stores native programs in binary that are prepared to handle this.
 
Lastly, and this is an extraordinarily important point. 
 
The objective of this lesson is not to make you a computer scientist, at least not yet.. The goal is to educate you on how to think conceptually about some of the fundamental inner workings of a computer. Some of these examples are simplified intentionally.
 
I will say that millions of millions of hours of work, lifetimes, and labor have gone into developing each element of your computer today. The design of logic gates, transistors, compilers, interpreters, screens, graphics processing, sound processing, and the thousands of layers of technology that work together to perform the necessary coordination of information across your computer’s circuitry. Each small element driving the computer holds an incredible story of its own. 
 
So there you go. That’s a semi-brief intro into computing and code. Hope it clicked.
 
Jake you must now complete your Utma Benefit Challenge quickly. 
 
“Close your eyes”, Dendro said.
 
“What??”, Jake asked.
 
“You must find the Utma Meditative State. Close your eyes, and meditate. You will find it. We all do.”

“What? Are you serious? Close my eyes. What am I supposed to do? How can I..Don't know what that even means”, Jake said.

“Trust me. Close your eyes. We don’t have much time.”, Dendro replied.

Jake closed his eyes. He squeezed his eyes shut, making the world around him as dark as possible. Then he peered into his mind. Something was drawing him deeper into his inner space. He felt like he was somewhere else. 

He saw it. It was a light reddish yellow fuzz in the corner of the front of this thoughts. He focused on it. 

“Woah!”., he yelled, with his eyes still closed tightly shut.

“Yes, it’s an experience for everyone. Their first time in the Utma Meditative State, generated by the Deep Universe”, Dendro said quietly.

Jake focused intensely on this red atmosphere that he unlocked in his head. He was physically transformed. He could no longer feel the outside world. He was standing on an enormous dock. There was an ocean in front of him. Dark clouds. Thunderstorms stirred in the atmosphere above. He saw an ovular disk floating ahead of him. He touched it gently. It was smooth. It smelled of the sea. When he touched it, large bright text illuminated in front of him.
YOU HAVE RECEIVED A LESSON IN COMPUTER AS MECHANISMS. THIS CHALLENGE TESTS THY UNDERSTANDING. 
 
A TRUTH TABLE IS A SIMPLE TABLE WHICH DESCRIBES ALL POSSIBLE SCENARIOS IN A LOGIC GATE. CREATE THE TRUTH TABLE FOR THE AND GATE. HERE IS A VISUAL UNDERSTANDING OF A BASIC TRUTH TABLE. THIS IS ALL THE INFORMATION YOU ARE PROVIDED.

const ChapterTwo12 = `Jake stared at the projection hanging in space. “Woah”. “Dendro I think I see what it means. We’re..wait. Yes. The input section is listing the different states of the input’s A and B? Dendro?

There was no response. “Dendro? Shit. He can’t hear me in here.”

Jake breathed through his teeth. “Ok, so, that’s my best guess. The input side of the table captures basically all the combinations of inputs. Then output...yes output will be the output based on the state of A and B ok. That’s not too bad. So how do I write this down?

SPEAK
 
“Speak? Ok. Well, in the first row of inputs please place Yes for A, and Yes for B. 
 
Jake saw a grid appear, but two red flashes appeared in a new grid that appeared in front of him. “I guess that wasn’t right. Crap. Um. What can I do to change this, I know the signals are binary. Yes and No’s. Umm. “Please place 1 for A and 1 for B.”
 
The grid disappeared and reappeared. This time it was filled up. 
`;

const ChapterTwo13 = `“So I guess that’s the right format. So if the 1’s correspond to YES, for the AND gate...with two YES’s, two 1’s hmm. Then the output is YES. So output should be 1 for this row. “Please enter 1 for the output in row 1.” 

The grid successfully updated.

“Ok so the next combination is 1 0. So for 1 0, the output will be NO because it needs both to be YES. 

“Please insert 1 0 for the inputs in row two, and 0 for the output. “

It updated successfully. 

“OK so what's next? This isn’t that bad. For row three please insert 0 1. And the output please insert 0.

It updated successfully. 

Is there another scenario? Hmmm. No. Wait yes. 0 0. Of Course. Both off. Please insert 0 0 0.

It updated. The the outline of the new graphic shifted from red to blue.

const ChapterTwo14 = `BASIC FLIGHT ATTAINED. PLEASE SET DESTINATION.
 
Jake looked. “Umm. Seattle, Washington.”

Jake stared at the graphic. It seemed he got it right. The blue glow was comforting. Then the scene began to zoom out quickly. The ocean, the sky, the graphic, he was whirling through, nothing. Then his eyes opened. And he could see Dendro again.

“Woah, that was trippy as ####”. Jake said. 

“You successfully entered the Utma Meditative State. I believe you passed the challenge.

Jake was having a hard time believing what he just accomplished.
 
“So what’s next? Did I “pass”? How do we know?
 
“You should be getting feedback from The Utma. That’s how it works. Hmm. I am almost positive this is exactly what the first challenge demands. I remember clearly from training”, Dendro said. 
 
“Aahh owww”, Jake screamed suddenly. 
 
He rolled up his sleeve. His upper right arm was burning. He pulled his sleeve up. His skin. It was burnt. No, he wiped off a thin layer of blood. A tiny alien marking was burnt into his arm, an inch above his elbow, on the side of his bicep. 
 
“What the ####? Jake yelled.
 
“Sorry, forgot to mention that. When any of us successfully complete a Benefit Teaching with The Utma, she marks us.”
 
“Are you serious? Is this going to come off?” Jake asked. 
 
“No. I’m afraid not”., Dendro responded.
 
“What? What does this marking mean?”, Jake asked.
 
“Well Jake. You receive a distinct marking whenever you complete a Benefit Teaching with The Utma. The Benefit Lesson you just passed was for Computers as Mechanisms. Your benefit, Basic Flight, will stay with you forever. 
 
You can now set basic flight instructions for long distance atmospheric flights on a Draconian Tier II pilot. You reserve that power permanently. You can now enter an Utma Meditative State and execute a basic atmospheric flight program at any time.”, the dragon replied.
 
Jake breathed sharply through his teeth and shook his head in frustration.
 
“That’s great, now how do I get this off, seriously, my mom will end my life!”, Jake yelled at the extraterrestrial.
 
“I am sorry. In the forces this is usually an extraordinarily positive moment. I am sorry it had to happen to you in this manner. There is nothing you or I can do about an Utma marking. It is a prized marking, your first Utma mark. If your mother knew what it meant, and that you did it to save both of our lives, I think she would understand”, Dendro said.
 
Jake was speechless. He was also infuriated. He did not expect that to happen. He rolled up his sleeve again to look at the marking. It looked like a sideways ‘h’, with three small straight lines emitted from the top. 
 
Jake looked down. A blueish beam emitted from the bottom of the Draconians's underbelly. An orange glow began to radiate through the underside of the dragon creature’s wings. A few of the white tattoo markings on the creature’s tough hide lit up.
 
The Draconian made two massive circular beats of its wings, and then pushed off the ground into the air. 
 
Jake's head jerked back as they were now on a sixty-degree angle, powering upward. The wings of the creature were now beating in powerful harmony, with no shift in motion or rhythm. The screen on the creature had not changed, though the lighting seemed to have dimmed a bit. A slight misty rain began to hit them. They continued to zoom into the air, their altitude increasing, and Jake looked back to see the fading glimmer of the lights of Grapefield passing below them.
