const ChapterTwo1 = `The scaled dragon-like creature stared directly at Jake. Its red eyes were blinking every few moments. Its body was almost entirely covered by the burnt-black rubble. All that was visible were the creature’s tail, neck, and head. Large pieces of metal debris and charred glass lay strewn across the pit. Something large was smoking off in the distance.
 
It looks like a “#### dragon” Jake thought, as Jake’s body started to vibrate in fear. Jake was now entirely operating on adrenaline. His body told him to run, and that’s what he did. He turned and sprinted, but he immediately tripped on the rising tail of the creature, which was far longer than he realized. 
 
He fell backward and hit his head on the ground. He scraped his arms as he tried to catch his fall, and he was now bleeding slightly. The creature was letting out loud moaning sounds and grumbles as if it were confused or in pain. The dragon thing, with a large struggle, freed its powerful body from the weight of the rubble. Dust and gravel spread throughout the air. The creature stood up on its back legs and shook its body in a similar fashion that his dog Rex did when he came out of a water bath.
 
Jake could see the creature clearly now. It was the size of a full-grown grizzly bear. It had an extremely long, rigidly scaled, greenish-brown tail, with an arrow-shaped end. Most noticeable were these etched white-grey tattoos that were present across the hide on its neck, arms, and back. The face was almost identical to that of a dragon. The creature had penetrating red eyes and a long, scaled snout.
 
To Jake’s horror, the creature slowly lowered its enormous head towards Jake’s face until it’s golf-ball sized nostrils were up against his face. It gave a massive snort, then a succession of smaller snorts. It then pulled its head back, and to Jakes's enormous surprise, it murmured “smells like shit”. Some smoke proceeded to come out of the creature’s nose, causing Jake to cough loudly. 
 
“What the ####” Jake thought to himself. How could this creature speak English? Jake backpedaled away from the creature. He was ready to run again. He sniffed his pits briefly to check his smell. But the creature came back and slowly mumbled “what is your name?”, in a deep, roar of a voice.
 
“JJJJake”, Jake said. He had forgotten his name momentarily.
 
“Jakee” the creature snarled. More smoke poured out of its nose. Its voice had a smokey hissing sound, but it wasn’t necessarily combative.
 
“Yes”, Jake replied…”whatt...are...you?” Jake asked.
 
“Whatt amm I? I am a...it paused for a second as if to think…..“I am a Naronian Draconod.” said the creature.
 
“What?”, Jake asked with extreme tension in his voice. 
 
The creature seemed to shake its head for a second as if it had water in its ears. “That’s better”, it exclaimed, with an oddly humanesque form of emotion.
 
Jake noticed some more odd markings on the dragon-like creature's wings as the creature stood up momentarily. They appeared to be weird looking, alien markings.
 
“Our Delta One Death Cruiser. It was hit. Our captain. He lost control. We went into a full tumble. We were ambushed. The Larhadian Asteroid Belt. Venthum. Three million eight hundred light years away. They knew we were coming...someone...someone gave us up?", the creature said as it looked up at the sky.
 
"How can this be?", the creature continued staring at the evening sky.
 
"We lost our right-wing.”, he blurted out in apparent mental anguish.
 
“In red-alert emergencies, Solar Forces Tier Two Draconian Pilots are only given a private ejection capsule with one light-year worth of fuel. It's a death sentence, almost.", the creature said to him as it turned to stare at Jake.
 
Jake paused for a second. He began to feel extremely dizzy.
 
"Wha, why, why, are you talking to me? I don't know what this is or where I am. I think I'm sick. I need my mom. Mom! I am hallucinating! I have been playing too many video games. Never again. I swear!", Jake said in terror as he closed his eyes waiting for something, or someone to wake him up from this dream.
 
He reopened his eyes, and nothing had changed. The alien dragon was still standing right in front of him.
 
"Venthum. They are cunning. My compatriots. My ship. I must get back. I do not understand how I ended up over three million light-years away. The Belt. It is not possible. How? How is this possible?", the creature said as it looked at the dirt and pondered momentarily.
 
"I only had one light-year worth of fuel," the creature said in a robust and low voice. 
 
The creature looked at him with intrigue. 
 
"It's no matter now. I remember seeing this planet on my Lithium-Radar. It was listed as a potentially inhabitable planet when I first ejected from our cruiser. Lithium Radar had detected solid ground with adequate nitrogen atmospheric levels for my fire-gills. But it was much too far to reach without an interstellar boost. I was paying attention to closer landing points in my space vicinity. There were a few stray asteroid belts within fifty parsecs of my previous location.” the creature said.
 
“It is impossible that I got here with one light year's worth of fuel”, the creature repeated again.
 
The creature paused for a moment.
 
“I do not understand. I am not even sure precisely where I am. One second.", the creature said, as it closed its eyes. “This certainly was not where I intended to end up.”, the creature exclaimed.
 
"Earth, you are on Earth," Jake said. 
 
"Erth?. Interesting name, hmm. Which system?", it asked.
 
"Uh." Jake wished he had paid more attention to astronomy. "The Milky Way?"
 
"Milky Way..hmm...no I have not heard of this. I am reviewing my Lithium Radar flight log. One moment, yes. I believe I am in what our ancestors termed the Nilofar System — Eta Omega. We are in a spiroid galaxy, of some sort, one of its outer arms. Let me check. Yes. That is correct. This makes no sense to me. I am baffled.”, it replied.
 
"How...how, how do you speak English?!, Jake exclaimed, feeling sick. He was still trembling and thinking of sprinting for his life again. The early evening sky was shifting into the darker night.
 
"Our Draconian forefathers mapped these far eastern systems many years ago. We have evolved over thousands of years to interpret language and dialects based on a wave signal all life forms give off, called the Utma. That's how I can speak your tongue."
 
"So you..you are an alien?" Jake asked with wonder.
 
"I guess that's what you'd call it. Although, on my home planet, many races are treated as aliens. Even though we immigrated to Naronia, a planet in The Nestomir Galaxy, multiple millennia ago.”
 
"Naronia?", Jake asked, not expecting the word to come out his mouth.
 
"Yes. Though my ancestors are from a planet called Draconia, which was destroyed thousands of years ago. In the early Sentient Age. I must get out of here. They are coming — the Venthum. Yes, I can see. Look up there. That is not a star. That is a Deathcruiser. I must move. We must move.", the creature uttered.
 
"Whattt? Who is coming? Death Cruiser?!" yelled Jake, his voice still trembling.
 
"We must leave now. Now. If you want to live, get on my back. Actually, if we want to live, get on my back. I can not fly long distance atmospheric trips alone. I need a commanding pilot.”, the creature said.
 
"Now!" the dragon-creature snorted as Jake jumped a foot in the air.
 
"Get on my back," said the creature as it lay partially sideways to allow Jake to climb on his dark green and brown scaled hide. The star in the sky was getting brighter. Jake wasn't sure if he fell too hard and was in a dream (or a nightmare). However, this Draconian monster seemed sincere about his concern about this Death Cruiser.
 
Jake decided he had no choice. Running through the maze corn field chased by angry aliens coming out of a battleship seemed worse than getting a ride on a crazy dragon thing's back. He hesitantly stepped onto the alien. 
 
He positioned himself on a scaled apparatus that seemed almost like a saddle built into the creature's body. He put his hands on the two protruding scales that felt and looked like handles. 
 
Then something unexpected happened. A large square portion of the Dragon's back slid down and tucked itself underneath another layer of its hide. And what appeared was unimaginable. A screen. Some kind of color screen.
 
“Listen carefully to what I say.”, Dendro said sternly.
 
“You must acquire your first Utma Benefit, right here, right now, for us to live. I don’t have time to explain everything, not even close. But recognize that the military systems from my home planet, Naronia, use Utma Generated Super Powers, or Utma Benefits, to fuel most of our military capabilities”, Dendro said. 
 
“What the #### is an Utma Benefit?”, Jake shouted out.
 
“Let me finish.”, Dendro said.
 
“Jake, recognize that our culture practices an ancient philosophy, known as Ld’Shab, which is derived from our appreciation, study, and worship of The Learning Force, The Utma.”, Dendro said. 
 
“Ld’Shab?”, Jake sputtered out-loud?
 
“Yes. And through our history of studying The Utma, we’ve learned that she incentivizes us to learn specific subjects she feels will better society long term.”
 
“Five hundred years ago we discovered the existence of physically tangible Utma Benefits. They are physical benefits we use to the military's advantage.”
 
“All Utma Benefits are tied to a distinct Utma Benefit Teaching. When a soldier needs to access an Utma Benefit, that soldier must receive the respective Benefit Teaching, and solve the respective Utma Benefit Challenge. The challenge is an exercise that demonstrates the soldiers knowledge of the subject matter.
 
“I’m dreaming. This is crazy.”, Jake said.
“No, this is real. 
 
“No, you are not dreaming. Now let me continue. Our Ld’Shab spiritual teachers work vigorously with military leaders to determine what lessons need to be taught, how they need to be taught, and how leaders need to think about each respective Utma Challenge. For example, what behaviors and thought processes must be demonstrated by a pupil to be considered a successful learner in the eyes of The Utma? Thousands of years of knowledge, testing, and evolution have gone into deriving this sacred knowledge pool. 
 
Dendro looked up at the stars above. The large white dot was getting brighter. Dendro curled his scaled head back around. Jake had a discombobulated look on his face. 
 
“You must still be lost. Here.”, Dendro paused briefly, contemplating his verbiage.
 
“We don’t have much time, minutes even, but I think it’s important to provide you with a tiny bit more context so that you have a chance of absorbing these lessons extremely quickly”, Dendro said, as he took a deep inhalation of air.
 
“Ld’Shab philosophy strongly believes that The Utma exists to guide our learning process so we can better our world. We believe that an intelligent being's purpose is to learn. Learning is our ultimate goal, as both individuals and as collective species. And more specifically, Ld’Shab believes life’s purpose is to learn with purpose. In our native tongue, the term for learning with purpose is known as Latisvha”.
 
“It’s essential to understand that Naronian society evolved and developed a Network, much like your Internet. They are nearly identical. Products, businesses, and all sorts of services run digitally over our Network, in the Nestomir Galaxy. Without The Network, our society would be crippled. We depend on it the same way The Milky Way does. For business, for networking, for logistics, military operations, and communication. It is essential to modern life.
 
Although The Network has its downsides, like the 18.7 septillion cat photos shared each day across our galaxy, it still has a glorious capability to enhance communication and collaboration amongst the living species in The Nestomir.
 
Society has begun to learn that The Learning Force, The Utma, has an intrinsic desire for her intelligent species to learn about computing and networking. Five hundred years ago we learned that she actually incentivizes us to do so through the Utma Benefits. 
 
“Does any of this make sense Jake?”, Dendro asked.
 
“I think so. Sounds a little….wacky.” Jake responded.
 
“First time hearing that, yes it does. And also, Jake, recognize, the Utma exists for you as much as it does for me. We are all a part of the same Universe”. Dendro added.
 
“If you say so”, Jake replied.
 
“I think that was good enough to get started...OK. Now where were we?”, Dendro said.
 
“Right. Yes. To complete a long distance atmospheric flight, a Tier II Draconian Solar Forces Pilot must possess a commanding pilot who has acquired the Utma Benefit of Basic Flight.” Dendro said.  
 
“The Utma Benefit of Basic Flight is tied to one of the Ld’Shab foundational Benefit Teachings called Zenshi Hedoku.” It is a short story recapping a famous spiritual teacher from our world. Dendro said. 
 
“Let’s begin, and listen carefully. I have not been trained as a spiritual teacher. But every military operative in the forces knows the core lessons, well enough. My memory of the lessons will have to do, for now.”, Dendro said.
 
“Let’s begin.”, Dendro said, staring at the sky.
 
“Five thousand years ago a famous Naronian Philosopher, named Zenshi Hedoku, was sitting by a river in the now lost Naronian continent of Akkrecious. He was pondering a specific set of writings of the First Ancients that he stumbled upon in the monastery.
 
The writings spoke of a prediction; the creation of calculation machines. They spoke of crude counting devices. Things that could add. Things that could subtract. There were no sketches. The First Ancients spoke of a need for switching devices to accomplish these calculation tasks. Not all of the writing made sense. But the idea intrigued Zenshi. Six thousand years later in Zenshi’s time, not much had been made of it. Wars got in the way.
 
As Zenshi stared at the river, something overcame him. He ran up to the monastery. It was built into the mountain. He walked into the communal bathroom and looked at the newly installed faucets by the local iron workers guild. He stared for a moment. A few fellow monks passed him. 
 
He ran back to his room. He took out his ink and papyrus parchment. And then he sketched.
`;

const ChapterTwo2 = `He described in his notes that a faucet was essentially a gate, a switch. He believed that there may be a way to use faucets to create a simple calculation machine. He remembered that the First Ancients mentioned that some kind of switch would be needed to accomplish this feat. He ran the idea by a few of his fellow monks. They asked if he had been smoking too much of his tobacco pipe.
 
He thought about it some more over the next few days. He felt he could make something out of his idea, and counter what his fellow monks believed. But it was a passing inspiration. He struggled to design anything useful. He was particularly flummoxed by how we could open and close the faucets without his hands, which was essential for his designs. But nothing was particularly effective, or practical, and the frustration shows in his writings. He ended up going back to his famous studies of forest animals and trees.
 
And that's the story.
 
“So the guy Zenshi, or whatever, never did anything else with the idea?”
 
“No, he never did anything else with it.
 
Jake thought for a moment.
 
“Jake you must now complete your Utma Benefit Challenge, so we can get out of here. 
 
“Close your eyes”, Dendro said.
 
“What?”, Jake asked.
 
“You must find the Utma Meditative State. Close your eyes, and meditate. You will find it. We all do.”

“What? Are you serious? Close my eyes. What am I supposed to do? How can I..Don't know what that even means”, Jake said.

“Trust me. Close your eyes. We don’t have much time.”, Dendro replied.

Jake closed his eyes. He squeezed his eyes shut, making the world around him as dark as possible. Then he peered into his mind. Something was drawing him deeper into his inner space. He felt like he was somewhere else. 

He saw it. It was a light reddish yellow fuzz in the corner of the front of this thoughts. He focused on it. 

“Woah!”, he yelled, with his eyes still closed tightly shut.

“Yes, it’s an experience for everyone. Their first time in the Utma Meditative State, generated by the Deep Universe”, Dendro said.

Jake focused intensely on this red atmosphere that he unlocked in his head. He was physically transformed. He could no longer feel the outside world. He was standing on an enormous dock. There was an ocean in front of him. Dark clouds. Thunderstorms stirred in the atmosphere above. He saw an ovular disk floating ahead of him. He touched it gently. It was smooth. It smelled of the sea. When he touched it, large bright text illuminated in front of him.


YOU HAVE RECEIVED A LESSON.
 
ZENSHI HEDOKU.
 
THIS CHALLENGE TESTS THY UNDERSTANDING. 
 
WHAT WAS ZENSHI HEDOKU’S INTENSION WITH FAUCETS?


Jake stared at the projected text hanging in space. “Woah”. “Dendro, how do I answer? What if I get it wrong?...Dendro?

There was no response. “Dendro? ####. He can’t hear me in here.”

Jake breathed through his teeth. 

“Uhh. Hello? How many tries do I get?”, Jake asked.

No response.

“What if I mess up? Do I get any help?”, Jake asked nervously.

No response.

“Uhhm. Well. I guess I will attempt an answer. The faucet. This guy, Zenshi. A monk. Nature dude. Read writings. Glancing at water. He was curious. Ran up to the bathroom. He was intrigued by the faucet. Why, umm. Because he thought a faucet could act as a switch?

The space where the yellow text was projected flashed a dark red.

“Crap, that was wrong? I guess I can try again.”, Jake muttered.

“But he did believe the faucet was a switch. At least that’s what Dendro’s story told. Hmm. Maybe The Utma is looking for context?. Zenshi believed a faucet could act as a switch. He was interested in this because the First Ancients believed a switch was needed to create a calculation machine.” 


UTMA BENEFIT TEACHING COMPLETE. BASIC FLIGHT BENEFIT ATTAINED. 
 
PLEASE SET YOUR DESTINATION.


Jake looked. “Woah. Guess it liked that answer. Umm. Seattle, Washington.”

The scene began to zoom out quickly. The ocean, the sky, the graphic, he was whirling through, turned into nothing. Then his eyes opened. And he could see Dendro again.

“Woah, that was trippy.” Jake exclaimed. 

“You successfully entered the Utma Meditative State. I believe you passed the challenge.

Jake was having a hard time believing what he just accomplished.
 
“So what’s next? Did I “pass”? How do we know?
 
“You should be getting feedback from The Utma. That’s how it works. The Utma cares about your understanding, not the specific words you use to answer. Hmm. I am almost positive this is exactly what the first challenge demands. I remember clearly from training”, Dendro said. 

“Aahh owww”, Jake screamed suddenly. 

He rolled up his sleeve. His upper right arm was burning. He pulled his sleeve up. His skin. It was burnt. No, he wiped off a thin layer of blood. A tiny alien marking was burnt into his arm, an inch above his elbow, on the side of his bicep. 
 
“What the ####? Jake yelled.
 
“Sorry, forgot to mention that. When any of us successfully complete a Benefit Teaching with The Utma, she marks us.”
 
“Are you serious? Is this going to come off?” Jake asked. 
 
“No. I’m afraid not”., Dendro responded.
 
“What? What does this marking mean?”, Jake asked.
 
“Well Jake. You receive a distinct marking whenever you complete a Benefit Teaching with The Utma. The Benefit Lesson you just passed was for Zenshi Hedoku. Your benefit, Basic Flight, will stay with you forever. 
 
You can now set basic flight instructions for long distance atmospheric flights on a Draconian Tier II pilot. You reserve that power permanently. You can now enter an Utma Meditative State and execute a basic atmospheric flight program at any time.”, the dragon replied.
 
Jake breathed sharply through his teeth and shook his head in frustration.
 
“That’s great, now how do I get this off, seriously, my mom will end my life!”, Jake yelled at the extraterrestrial.
 
“I am sorry. In the forces this is usually an extraordinarily positive moment. I am sorry it had to happen to you in this manner. There is nothing you or I can do about an Utma marking. It is a prized marking, your first Utma mark. If your mother knew what it meant, and that you did it to save both of our lives, I think she would understand”, Dendro said.
 
Jake was speechless. He was also infuriated. He did not expect that to happen. He rolled up his sleeve again to look at the marking. It looked like a sideways ‘h’, with three small straight lines emitted from the top. 
 
Jake looked down. A blueish beam emitted from the bottom of the Draconians's underbelly. An orange glow began to radiate through the underside of the dragon creature’s wings. A few of the white tattoo markings on the creature’s tough hide lit up.
 
The Draconian made two massive circular beats of its wings, and then pushed off the ground into the air. 
 
Jake's head jerked back as they were now on a sixty-degree angle, powering upward. The wings of the creature were now beating in powerful harmony, with no shift in motion or rhythm. The screen on the creature had not changed, though the lighting seemed to have dimmed a bit. A slight misty rain began to hit them. They continued to zoom into the air, their altitude increasing, and Jake looked back to see the fading glimmer of the lights of Grapefield passing below them.
