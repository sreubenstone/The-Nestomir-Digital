const ChapterOne1 = `Rex dove into Jake Addison with high impact. Rex’s chilled nose positioned itself against Jake’s right eye socket. This sudden impact caught Jake off guard. Jake had been in the middle of a dream regarding a quarrel he had in school the previous day. 

It took Jake a few milliseconds before Jake comprehended what was happening. Rex, the family monster, as they called the extremely furry apricot colored canine, often visited Jake’s room on weekday mornings.

The family believed Rex initiated this collision for two reasons. One, Rex wanted to greet his Homosapien sibling. Two, Rex wanted bacon. Delicious, salivating bacon. The Addison family was confident that Rex was aware that if Jake wasn’t downstairs, then food wouldn’t be served, and if bacon wasn’t being served, Rex couldn’t get a treat. 

Jake spent a minute petting Rex. He enjoyed getting right underneath Rex’s chin. Jake would scratch the beast in a slow, forceful two-fingered combing motion. This act was just enough to put Rex in a temporary state of euphoria. 

Jake got out of bed. He walked over to the window in his bathroom and glanced outside. It was nice out. Autumn was in full bloom. Jake considered what the day at Grapefield Middle would deliver. He forgot to do his social studies homework, he would have to copy it off Anna Rodrigues again.

He brushed his teeth, combed his hair as well as he could, and got dressed quickly. Jake’s mother, Maria, often made Jake bacon and eggs for him on school mornings. He could smell the scent streaming into his room, and it added a jolt of encouragement to Jake’s step as he got dressed. He put on a pair of jeans, a white v-neck undershirt, and a thick Lucky Brand hoodie.

Jake walked down the steps and saw his Mom mixing eggs. His brother Jared, who was three years younger, was eating Cheerios. “Why do you always wear that stupid hoodie?” Jared sneered at his brother.

“I love it, that’s why. It keeps me warm, especially in Ms. Ranna’s freezing social studies class. That #### AC vent is right over me! You act like you have any style whatsoever, bum. So be quiet." Jake countered. 

Jared put his head down and continued eating. He proceeded to shake his head deliberately. 

It wasn’t inaccurate to state that Jake tended to re-wear clothing a little too often. The primary reason for this rewearing of his ensemble was because he was against doing laundry. He felt laundry was an inefficient time drain and an annoyance. 

Jake Addison didn't exactly care how he smelled. He knew he smelled alright. He knew that if he added the right amount of morning shower time, deodorant, and Zegna cologne, he could save himself the weekly chore of doing laundry. His mother Maria could not figure out where these weird traits manifested from.

Jake did, of course, did laundry every now and then, just not at the "standard" frequency of most well-groomed human beings. He also never had a girlfriend or a relationship of any kind. But he was only thirteen, and in seventh grade, so that was perfectly ok.

Jake Addison was also something of an introvert. He spent most of his time with his closest friend Nassir. He had spent many nights awake, frustrated, hoping he could bring new relationships into his life that would fill some of the emptiness he felt inside. Ever since his father left the picture, he felt hungry for something, for someone but he could place exactly what was missing. Was it companionship? Was it conquering some of his social demons? Was it something else? Jake didn’t know. The urge to better himself was hidden deep down, locked behind the many barriers and iron gates across the fortress of his mind.

He also procrastinated. When an assignment was given, he waited to the the infinitesimally last second to complete it. Things he didn’t care for were backlogged. Things he enjoyed were prioritized. He didn’t know any better. Yet. 

Jake Addison had an intense passion for playing video games. He played Fortnight, studied Twitch videos into the deep hours of the night, and he had a unique ability to dominate Madden NFL games on his PS4 amongst his closest friends and online opponents. 

Jake recently witnessed (or heard) an older twenty something opponent from a country he had never heard of have a mental breakdown when Jake threw a touchdown to DeAndre Hopkins with one second left in an online Madden match. 

“GOT EM”, Jake screamed. 

Jake’s opponent proceeded to howl in an unknown language for at least 60 seconds in a madness and rage Jake had never been in the presence of before.

Jake also had a passion for drones and uncommon electronic gadgets. He enjoyed watching alluring YouTube videos covering do-it-yourself-ers from around the world constructing thought-provoking robotics projects. Jake’s father had a long standing career in the Finance industry, but his grandfather was an adept civil engineer. Jake’s father mentioned that a lot of his engineering interests were probably inherited, and that they also skipped a generation. Jake wondered if something like that was really passed down by blood.

One of Jake’s favorite do it yourself electronics projects was a miniature autonomous motor boat which sailed from the coast of Sydney, Australia, all the way to San Diego, California. The creator of the project was a full time engineer for some obscure hardware manufacturing company who pursued quirky passion projects with his spare time. The engineer videoed the entire life cycle of the project, from its assembly, to its launching off the coast of Australia, to it being tracked via GPS from his computer, all the way to its shore landing in San Diego. Jake always wondered why people these brilliant weren’t working for themselves.

His mother Maria bought him a Zen X Maker Mini Drone Kit last summer. He assembled it partially with the help of online Reddit forums. His friend Nassir, who was a science nerd, helped him finish the harder parts of the assembly. Jake stared in awe as Nassir wired up the components. Zen X was a learning kit, and a lot of the "professional" work was already completed. Jake understood the basic functionality of the drone, and why certain parts were going in certain positions. However, as had occurred in previous projects, Jake recognized that he was missing something, a certain comprehension. There was a much deeper world of science and mathematics hidden to his eye. 

“Relax, my children," Jake’s mother Maria hummed in a melodic voice as she faced them and walked towards the kitchen table. "My two boys need to eat so that we can get to school on time. You can argue about your hoodie choices later”.

Jake sat down at the table. He proceeded to pick at his breakfast. His Mom usually mastered the dish, but today the eggs were a little overcooked, and something was off with the bacon. He managed to finish three-quarters of the plate. He then quickly tossed the rest out so his Mom wouldn’t see.

“Let’s go. It’s already 8:30.”, Maria said sternly.

The boys got up and followed their mother through the garage door. The garage smelled of gasoline. The famous grey Toyota minivan, or the "mom-mobile," as Jake and his brother called it, was sitting there in all of her beauty. The three of them entered the vehicle.

Maria opened the garage door and then pulled slowly out of the driveway, looking both ways, and began the five-minute drive journey to Grapefield Middle. The mom-mobile was not a beautiful vehicle, but it got the job done. It hummed down Angle street. The engine made a deep, low frequency hum, as it traversed down the road. 

The streets in Grapefield were pretty in the fall. A creamy yellow and brown luster was emitted from everywhere in sight, as the leaves cascaded on top of lawns, roofs, and freshly laid pavement. The mini-van churned down the Grapefield streets. They passed by the Grapefield town hall, where Jake’s aunt (his mother’s sister), Holly, worked. A minute later they passed by the Grapefield train station. He saw people getting on and off the train, on their way to work. Maria turned right on Barley street.

Five minutes later, they approached Grapefield Middle’s school gates. Jake’s mother pulled the car up directly in front of the school’s main entrance. This maneuver usually made Jake cringe as he had to get out of his Mom’s car in front of all of the bypassing students. Jake hesitantly got out of the car ashis mother wished him good luck with the day. “Don’t fall asleep in class, Jake! I don't want another phone call from Ms. Thornton!!” his mother yelled. 

The minivan pulled off, heading towards Grapefield Elementary, to drop off his brother Jimmy, who was in fifth grade. Jake shook his head in minor frustration as he headed for the school entrance. 

Grapefield Middle was a typical suburban middle school. Classes started at 8:50 am and ended at 2:10 pm every day. The school had the usual cliques and personality types you see in middle schools. Different reading group levels, athletes, nerds, and everything in between populated the classrooms and hallways. School lunch and substitute teacher's classes were the most prized moments of the student schedule. Students dreaded homework assignments and long papers. Students fell asleep in social studies. Teachers reported gossip and complained about poorly behaving students in the faculty lounges, and school bullies patrolled the hallways looking for their next set of victims.

Jake passed gradually through Algebra, and English class. Jake was almost sure he had entered a twenty-minute slumber during his English teacher’s motif explanation concerning Catcher In The Rye. The period ended finally, and Jake headed for his locker.

“Yo, Jake!”. 

Jake turned around. His friend Nassir was hustling down the hallway towards him. Jake couldn’t believe that Nassir was actually wearing the brown suspenders he saw in Nassir’s room last weekend. Jake loved Nassir, but his nerdiness was overwhelming at times. 

“Nice outfit”, Jake said, smirking at Nassir. 

“Oh, these. Thanks. They were an old pair of papas. They fit well, right?”, Nassir replied.

“Yea, they fit perfectly my friend”, Jake said as he rolled his eyes. Nassir didn’t seem to notice.

“My brother brought home a fully working quadcopter kit from University. It was his senior design project. The piece of beauty was designed to help fishermen plant fishing lines in hard to reach places. It has full air stabilization capabilities, and the thing is waterproof. It’s too cool. Nabir said I can fly it later. Let’s test it out after school.”, Nassir said with profound excitement.

“Umm...for real.. It’s waterproof?” Jake asked, as his eyes bulged with wonder.

“Yes. It even has a live video feed that you can stream over a GSM connection. How crazy is that? We can spy on people! Or go fishing.” Nassir grinned as he replied. 

“Wow. That’s pretty radical. I dreamed about a drone like that once.” Jake felt an electric shiver run up his spine. He had always dreamed of flying a real quadcopter with video stream capabilities. The possibilities with one of those things were endless. 

“Let’s do it. I’ll meet you at the main steps after the ninth period.”, Jake said back.

“Sounds good Jake”, Nassir said.

Jake was about to turn around and walk to his next class but Nassir was standing there as if he still had something on his mind.

“What is it”, Jake asked.

“Umm, well, I should mention, I overheard from a few younger students that Dylan Jenkins still has his thoughts focused on you. I think he’s hungry for more prey. That jerk. I’m sorry he has it in for you this year. Be careful.”, Nassir said.

“Ah. Who said that?”, Jake replied.

“Ari Peterson was talking to that other short kid he hangs out with in grade seven. He said Dylan pulled his pants down during second period gym, and that Dylan also mentioned he couldn’t wait until he saw you”, Nassir replied.

“Crap”, Jake said, as he looked down to his feet. 

“I gotta get to class, Jake, see you later”, Nassir said. 

Nassir hustled down the hall, his suspenders clinging to him tight.

Jake exchanged his textbook at this locker and then walked to Earth Science class. He had a sick feeling in his stomach. He tried to take his mind off Dylan, but that was easier said than done. 

During Earth Science, his teacher, Mr. Puedo, went on and on about the importance of sedimentary rock formations. Jake could not comprehend how someone could have such an obsession for rocks. 

He saw a few students in the back of the classroom snoozing. His friend Jason always kept a pen upright in his hand so that when he fell asleep in class, it appeared as if he was still awake, even if his face was flat down against the desk. It seemed to fool his teacher more times than not (unless, of course, he was called on). Jake thought it was a trick worth studying, and odds worth playing.

The bell rang after Earth Science and Jake headed for his locker once again. He was packing away his Earth Science and Algebra textbooks when Dylan Jenkins came up from behind him. A short, but forceful right jab, collided with Jake’s left kidney.

Jake slumped over and yelled, “what the xxxx man!” but Dylan proceeded to bear-hug Jake’s body and put his right leg in front of Jake’s right leg and then pushed. Jake fell to the ground, and a few textbooks from Jake’s locker followed to drop on Jake’s leg. “Ow, dammit!” Jake yelled. 

Dylan backed away for a moment. “That’s what you get for wearing that hoodie over and over again!”, Dylan yelled. Dylan proceeded to take a giant kick at Jake’s right thigh. “AOOHHWW”, Jake screamed. Dylan looked both ways then hustled down the hall before more students walked up on them.

Dylan chose Jake as a bullying target at the end of Jake’s freshman year at Grapefield Middle. Jake was watching the Grapefield High School Football team after school when Dylan saw Jake sitting in the bleachers. “That’s a funny looking haircut, dude, who cut your hair, your blind grandmother?” Dylan shouted at him from a few rows below. Jake turned around and saw a vicious, crazy look in Dylan's eyes, and tried to look away. From that point on, any time he saw Dylan, something unpleasant would happen to him, like a sarcastic shout, name-calling, or some kind of minor physical intimidation. “Just stay away from him, try to avoid him”, Nassir told him. “These people have no reason for the things they do”.

Jake’s mom mentioned to Jake once that Dylan Jenkins was probably a deeply insecure individual. “That boy probably has demons in him that we can’t fully understand. Do your best to stay out of his way. It’s best not to bring yourself trouble you can avoid.”, she told him.

Jake turned his head and saw a few students passed by, giving Jake a pitying look.

Jake stood up; he could feel the center of his right thigh throbbing. He was furious. He rocketed his textbooks into his locker. They made a series of loud bangs as they collided with the metal and fell to the floor. He slammed the door closed, and didn’t bother to lock his locker shut.

"Why are some people such xxxx?" he asked himself.

In Social Studies, Jake fidgeted aggressively with his number two pencil. A stream of aggravated thoughts passed through his consciousness as he contemplated Dylan. He began to scratch the laminar coating of his desk with his pencil, making a grating sound. Several students turned around and looked at him with annoyed looks on their faces. 

"My fault," Jake groused.

A few minutes passed, and Jake decided to raise his hand and signaled to his teacher that he had to go to the bathroom. Something told him he had enough lectures for the day. He waved his hand again to catch Mrs. O’Reilly’s attention. Mrs. O'Reilly waved him permission. Jake immediately got up and tucked his textbooks and pencil under his arm and abruptly walked out of the classroom.

Jake's classmates watched him in confusion as Jake was carrying all of his belongings.

Jake started walking down the hall. What his next step was going to be, Jake was not sure. 

That's when the love of his life shouted at him.

"Hey, man!" yelled Ashley. 

Ashley was one of the most stunning girls in Grapefield Middle, and Jake had spent a good part of Algebra class staring at her. She was the love of Jake's life. Jake had also never spoken to her. Jake had spent plenty of nights awake in bed thinking about Ashely.

The most he ever accomplished in person was a series of "heh, hi, ho" grunts he aimed in her direction when he held a door open for her last year in home-ec class.

"Heh..hey," Jake said as calmly as he could, not trying to sound surprised Ashley was talking to him. It took him a second to achieve any sense of composure.

"You're Jake, correct?” Ashley asked. 

"Yea, yes," Jake replied.

“I think you’re in my Algebra class. I am in a bit of a pickle. I fell asleep early last night. I'm embarrassed to ask, apologies, but is there any way I could borrow the homework assignment due tomorrow?” she asked.

“Sorry, I don’t have it. I’m probably going to flunk this class this quarter.”, Jake responded. 

“Oh, okay, no worries. Sorry to hear that. By the way, is your leg ok? I see you’re limping.”, she asked.

“Uh, yea, flag-football. Yes, it’s fine.”, Jake responded.

“Ok, well, I’m also having a birthday party next weekend at The Cheesecake Factory in town. You should come. The information is on Facebook. I’ll invite you.”, Ashley said.

“Oh, oh, well, thank, thanks. I will take a look.”, Jake replied.

“Great! See you later.”, said Ashely.

“That was so random,” Jake thought. Getting kidney punched and tripped by Dylan and then speaking to Ashley for the first time all in an hour and change. 

“I’m glad I had my adrenaline running, or else I’m not sure I would have been able to speak to her in understandable English,'' Jake thought to himself.

Jake continued walking down the hallway. He had conflicting emotions running inside of him. The excitement of speaking to Ashley. The pain of being preyed on by Dylan. 

Jake continued walking down the hall. Grapefield Middle had two floors shaped like a giant "U”. Classrooms interspersed the hallways every twenty feet on both sides. There were also large windows on the inner side of the hall (the side of the hall following the inner-perimeter of the U) that looked out onto an internal courtyard. Jake could see teachers lecturing and students sitting at their desks. Occasionally he’d see a head turn to see who was walking by. 

Jake hit the exit staircase on the east side of the school. He couldn’t stand being in Grapefield Middle or those hallways, or those classes, any longer that day. Something, which he couldn't fully explain, a particular force, drove him outside. 

Two hours before classes ended, he opened the school doors and walked out. He walked down the exit path. His mind was searching for somewhere to go. 

There was a slight breeze, but it was not cold out. It was a typical cool autumn day. He definitely had no desire to return home yet, and that was not an option, as his mother could catch him coming home from school early. He pushed himself to think of all the places that could bring fulfillment to the day. 

It hit him as he hit the pavement. An old temptation. A place the tougher kids used to talk about in Grapefield: Phantom Fireworks. It was only a twenty-five minute walk across town. 

“That’s where I’m going”, Jake thought.

Jake was on Barley street, which led straight into town from school. Jake began the trek. 

Fall was in full effect. All sorts of exotic colored leaves dropping across the road and sidewalk. A few strangers he passed by looked at him with curiosity. It was odd to see a child this early in the day on the Grapefield streets. But not much else was made of it. 

Grapefield was a cozy suburban town, at least most of it. Located in central Wisconsin, it was a typical middle-class suburb that you might find in an American feel-good tv show. The houses were charming and quaint. The parents had two to three children. The summers were hot. The winters were cold. The Fall was particularly beautiful. Parents, like anywhere else, prayed for the best for their kids. School was competitive, but not as competitive as some of the suburban towns on the east and west coasts. Life was pleasant here for most. 

The central town of Grapefield was well constructed. The two main streets, Barley Street and Amherst Road, intersected in the dead-center of town. The best Italian spots, Asian restaurants, coffee shops, and ice cream parlors all lay on Barley. The essential grocery, hardware, and supply stores lay on Amherst. The sidewalks had newly paved red brick, with smooth, grey mortar in between them. The town center felt a little like the Hamptons, on Long Island, a place they had visited as a family a few summers ago when Jake’s father, Joe, was still a part of their lives.

Jake continued walking east down Barley street. He passed the Radio Shack where his mom bought him his first electronics kit - a do it yourself motion detection alarm system for your bedroom. He passed the restaurants he knew all so well. He passed Haagen Daz on his left. Memories of summer ice cream milkshakes topped with the richest chocolate fudge he’s ever tasted sprinkled through his mind. He even saw some familiar faces eating lunch. 

He made a right onto Amherst Road and headed South. About ten minutes later he began to approach Lemmingfield. This was the poorer neighborhood in the southern part of Grapefield. The misfits and delinquents were rumored to stir up the most trouble here. Of course, there were plenty of honest people of modest means living in Lemmingfield, but the neighborhood was known to have its fair share of issues. 

Jake had never been in Lemmingfield. He never had a reason to visit. He never had the courage to visit Phantom in the past.

A distant memory flicked through his head. It was the memory of a time he heard Bill Jones, an admirable, older bad #### currently enrolled in Grapefield High School, telling a story about Phantom Fireworks. Jake and Jimmy Jones (Bill’s younger brother) were outside Grapefield Middle waiting for the bus when Jake heard Bill telling a story to a few tenth grade girls. Bill described a journey he made one summer to Phantom Fireworks. The tale consisted of him buying a pack of jumbo size firecrackers and proceeding to almost incinerate the dock at Goggins Lake on a July 4th weekend. The tale amused Jake. 

“I wish I was that audacious”, Jake thought. “The girls would look at me with admiration.”, Jake thought.

Jake could see he was crossing Washington Street. He knew from the map he was approaching the border between Lemmingfield and northern Grapefield. That meant that Phantom Fireworks was only a few blocks away. 

A few teenage boys riding bmx bikes sped around him. Jake thought they were going to ride right into him. 

“Jeez '', Jake said out loud, peering back at the reckless bmxers.

He continued his trek. He kept his head on a swivel, making sure he was more alert in this part of town.

Jake noticed that the streets were noticeably not well maintained here. Whereas the northern part of the town had perfectly paved streets and uncracked sidewalks, down here, the roads and sidewalks looked like they had not been paved in decades. There were also plenty of disheveled warehouses and broken down garages populating both sides of the street.

Jake continued walking. He knew Phantom was about to come into view.

There she was! Standing on the south east side of Amherst & Crescent Ave, was Phantom Fireworks. She looked as beautiful as Jake imagined she would. A large old-fashioned neon sign with a big fireworks icon stood above the store’s entrance. It looked like a hardware store, but Jake knew she was something entirely different.

Jake entered the store with exhilaration. He could hear a sound effect in his head that tv shows make when a character finds a prized, hidden location. “TaDaaah.” 

The store had ten aisles. Each aisle had its own variety of goods. Endless assortments of fireworks, firecrackers, and plenty of other gizmos Jake couldn’t recognize lined the shelves of each aisle. He felt warm chills radiating down each dendritic spine and axon ending in his body.

Jake saw a few bikers with leather jackets walking around the aisles, exchanging jokes between one another. He couldn’t hear what they were saying.

Jake’s mood began to augment as he pranced around the store. He had been sullen on his walk, thinking about Dylan’s actions. He was feeling weak for giving Dylan so much attention in his head. 

“Don’t let nasty people take up your mental energy, you only have so much of it.” Jake remembered his father once said to him. That line always rang true in his head.

He ran his hands across the firework packages. There was so much fire power packed in these tiny bundles. Another soothing chill ran through him.

Jake continued to walk down the Phantom aisles. He approached packages which contained what looked like small red rockets. These fireworks were too big even for Jake’s mischievous appetite. He wanted something especially simple that he could mess around with to let his stress out, and let the day shake off him. 

He walked around the group of shouting bikers and saw a few Jelly Popping Packs laying on the upper shelves. He knew what these little guys could do. They were tiny fireworks with long fuse bottoms that blew jelly everywhere when the timed fuse cartridges ignited. 

“Perfect,” Jake thought to himself. He reached up, standing on his toes, and grabbed a pack.

He checked out at the cash register in the front of the store. The bikers were in front of him in line and they had three enormous bags filled with who knows what inside. Jake wondered what they were up to tonight. 

Jake completed his checkout and walked out of Phantom Fireworks, Jelly Poppers in hand. Jake had some new pep in his step. As he walked outside onto Barley street, he noticed a distinctive scent in the air. It seemed to be coming from the west side of the street. He tucked the poppers in his right jean pocket.

The scent smelled of cedar wood and firework smoke. It was a pleasing scent — something like a mixture of toy model rocket engines and some kind of exotic tree or plant. 

He followed the scent, though he was not sure if he had just picked up some of the “explosive” material seeping through the doors of the fireworks store. The gunpowder and fireworks aroma dust did smell good. But this was different. Did it smell better? 

As he walked towards the west side of the street, he noticed the smell appeared to be coming from an alley in between two large car repair depots. Then the smell suddenly went away.

“Must be in my head,” Jake thought. 

But a sudden passing gust of wind brought the smell back, and this time it was significantly stronger. This stronger version of the scent changed his mind again. 

He continued into the alley, heading west. It was dark and smelled of garbage, but the cedary-model-rocket-engine scent was still present. He was startled as he tripped and almost fell on a homeless man lying under a few layers of filthy tarps on the ground. “Sorry,” he said and accelerated his pace through the alley.

The other side of the alley finally opened up onto a well-lit street. 

“Woah, this is how close we are to The Cornfield?”, I had no idea. “This is the Cornfield. Wow. I haven’t been here in ages.”

The Cedar Oaks Cornfield was a fifty thousand acre Cornfield which powered many of the jobs in Grapefield. It was located on the southwest border of the town. The massive corn plot sat between Grapefield and the neighboring town of Livingston. Farmers from both towns had divided up the terrain in the 1960’s.

The last time Jake was here was on an elementary school field trip focusing on the agricultural output of the town and Grapefield’s founding history. There was no other reason to be on the South Western side of town. All the action, highways, and routes to interesting cities were located in the North Eastern end of Grapefield.

Jake walked onto the street. This was Jason Road. Jason Road bordered the entire ten mile long Eastern border of the cornfield. The alley had taken him to the almost precise North East corner of Cedar Oaks. 

The street lamps were illuminating the first cut of the corn plants which were swaying in the now evening wind. 

The scent started getting stronger. Jake picked up his pace. He walked across the street and ducked under the wooden picket fence.

“These things are massive,'' Jake muttered out loud as he entered the corn plot. The corn stalks were intimidating; they were much taller than him. He completely lost sight of Jason road once he took a few steps into the field. He was not able to see more than a foot or so in each direction. But the smell was still there, and the twinkling evening sky above him gave him some comfort that he was not entirely suffocating inside the towering corn stalks. 

He continued walking. He decided to curve right, following a path of slightly shorter corn stalks. He also noticed black sut on the top third of the stalks here. 

He continued walking in this direction.

“I hope I don’t get lost”, Jake thought fearfully.

But his curiosity overcame his concern. He wiped his finger across a corn leaf and tasted the sut. It resembled the cedary smell from before, but a little more raw and smokey. 

He continued his walk. 

The stroll through the cornfield became a relaxed effort. It was a complete juxtaposition to the busy suburban life Jake was used to in Grapefield. He was in  nature. He could hear nature. The sky was clear above him. Jake couldn’t believe this alternate universe sat so near his house, and he was never aware of it. 

“Woah, what the #### was that?” he muttered as a thick plume of smoke pushed up through the cornfield and surrounded him and moved past him. Something was smoking. Something was on fire, not too far off in the distance. 

He continued walking. He ducked a little to the right again as he followed the scent. He could see the tips of each stalk were showing burn marks. It appeared as if a lighter had burnt the top of them.

He swiveled his head back and forth to examine the stalks. It became evident that something odd was going on about thirty degrees to the right of the direction in which he was currently walking. The stalks in this direction were burnt nearly down to the ground. This pattern was peculiar, at the least. Jake followed in this direction, walking over these extremely short, burnt, stalks. He followed this direction for another twenty seconds until he entered a large circular opening in the field, and then he saw it, or no, he heard it. 

A low but powerful grumble made the ground tremble. A thick, scaled tail with engraved alien looking markings on its hide was sticking out of the earth. It was about two feet in front of where Jake entered this round pit. The tail was wiggling slowly, as if trying to get free. Then, a massive sandstorm erupted from the ground, at least that’s what it felt like. And then its head came up out of the sand. It’s dark red eyes turned towards Jake.
