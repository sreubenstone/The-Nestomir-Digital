const Prologue1 = `The night was dark except for a subtle luminescence. Stars from Andromeda and other galaxies billions of miles away emitted a faint light that grazed everything on the ground.
 
The lush cornfield was swaying in the wind, making a slight bristling noise as the northwesterly winds passed. It was a chilly night. A local would probably be wearing multiple layers at this temperature. 
 
But there were no souls in this cornfield on this night in Grapefield, Wisconsin. If there were, they would have seen something that looked like a reddish-white firework exploding a few miles above them. Observers on the ground would have witnessed a great big, fiery white streak and burning, smoking molten metal showering down on the Earth. And if they lived through that, they would have heard a big BOOOM.
