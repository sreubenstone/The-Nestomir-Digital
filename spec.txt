scroll defaults to book marked position


im forgetting other apps store multiple bookmarks. need to think about the spec again.

--- you HAVE to return to book mark position to unbookmark!! that's it.


--- performance and refactor next ---

...rerendering
...scroll event (or set state???????????) really only needs to fire every few inches.
